<p>The passage from <b>Japan</b> (Shimoda) to <b>Canada</b> (Victoria) took <b>51 days</b>, and it was the hardest thing we've ever done. We decided to keep a logbook, to better remember it and so it can help others who wish to make this trip.</p>

		<td>We woke up early today, as we had little time to prepare before leaving Japan. We're usually more organized than this, with only a few menial tasks to do, but not this time. We had to find a post box to send the pocket wifi we rented and to fill our water — this may not seem like much, but it was as it piled up on top of other things I'd forgotten, like adding the pot holders to the stovetop (finding them first is also tricky), installing the jack lines, taking out the tethers, putting key items back in the ditch bag plus a number of other last minute things that had escaped my mind.</td>

		<td>We meet Shuhei, Thomas and Anja on Robusta for coffee, although we turn down a cup as coffee never sits right on the first day at sea. Though, we use this opportunity to chat, all the while butterflies gather in my gut. I am nervous. I always am before a big trip and this time is no different, although this is our biggest passage yet, and will also likely be the most challenging. My gut has every right to twist itself into knots. We ask Shuhei to drop off our pocket wifi in a post box, he agrees ­— ah, what a kind person. He came by this with his truck to help Robusta with some last minute tasks, like getting produce, gas etc. We had done most of that ahead of time.</td>

		<td>We push off our spot and head over to the Shimoda Boat Services pontoon to fill our water. We tied up to it and began to ferry bins back and forth to empty them in our tank. We filled as many recipients as we could carry, as we don't know how long the trip will take. Once the tanks and jerry cans were full, we left the pontoon and headed outside of the breakwater. The Shimoda coastguard ship was lifting anchor at the time, it went past us, disappearing quickly as it was going fast. Outside of the breakwater, we saw the lighthouse on our starboard side, the one we had difficulty rounding when we arrived here a week and a half ago due to 30-knot winds off our bow. Today, the seas were tame and the skies clear and blue. <br/><br />We saw the Kurofune, a replica of Commodore Perry's black ship, doing its tourist rounds just outside of the harbor. It was the first time we'd seen it on the water, as there weren't many tourists before due to concerns with the coronavirus. Now that the state of emergency's been lifted, people started traveling more around the country.</td>

		<td>The current is pushing us along, fast. We passed Oshima island at a ridiculous speed of 9.5 knots...! The kuroshio (black current) is very strong in this area, and even stronger between the islands as the water is forced through a narrow opening. We had no problem with ships, even with many heading to Tokyo. Our speed made it easy to work our way out of the main shipping channel. We are flying! Pino is happy to be moving again, and as are we.</td>

		<td>We saw porpoises in the water! It's been too long! We missed them. Winds are coming out of the SW, at a good speed of 12-15 knots. We're going at 8 knots. For lunch, we had inari pouches, a meal we'd purchased at MaxValue the night before. It's nice not having to cook on the first day. Neither of us are sea sick, but going below is still difficult and can easily trigger it. We stay outside instead, enjoying the good wind, weather and sun. <br /><br />Devine is reading "The mushrooom at the end of the world", while I steer us east. We tried calling Robusta on the VHF, but got no answer, either they're too far or their radio isn't on.</td>

		<td>We download the weather, it is the same as yesterday, but it looks like the wind will increase this evening. Both of us are feeling sick and grumpy. We're experiencing the early symptoms of sea sickness, which usually means a headache, reduced appetite, morose view on things etc. This happens on every trip. Neither of us have ever vomited, thankfully. Yesterday we sent Robusta an email and got a reply, they are ok and are southwest of us.</td>

		<td>We napped hard, then awoke and decided that we should try and cook something. Neither of us felt like eating rice balls, we regretted getting so many as we weren't sure we could eat them. We had no appetite, but tried to eat anyway. We ate raw snap peas as a snack the texture was weird in our mouths. Devine made spicy ramen, which were very, very spicy. I couldn't finish my bowl. We had a grapefruit for desert, and made a mess on deck trying to pry it apart. The deck had red on it for a while afterwards.</td>

		<td>We check the weather again. We don't normally check it twice a day as it eats up data, but the weather was changing so fast...! We wanted to know what was going on. We're glad we looked, as the wind was set to increase by a lot. If we hadn't checked, we might not have set the second reef point in our main.</td>

		<td>We've reduced the jib, as the wind is a strong and steady 27 knots. We are sailing eastward, although the current has pushed us higher than we wanted. We are at 36 degrees, and it is worrisome as we knew it was safer to stay under 35. The wind above that line tends to be stronger. Robusta was at 33 degrees, upon exiting Shimoda they took a more southerly route, I wish we'd done the same. We underestimated the strength of this current. We have peanut butter toast with slices of banana on top for breakfast.<br /><br />Devine sent a happy birthday message to his sister.</td>

		<td>The waves are getting bigger. We are worried about our fresh produce as we can't eat any of it. This has never happened to us before. The sun is warm and is hastening the rotting of some of the more sensitive vegetables, like broccoli. We had to throw away half a head overboard. I hope we'll find our appetites again, I'd rather the food end up in our stomachs than in the ocean.</td>

		<td>Devine tried to make a salad for lunch to try and use up some of our ugly produce. As i ate the wind blew food off of my fork, maybe not the best meal to have on a windy day. The wind is blowing 25-30 knots, generating big waves, but at least it is sunny?</td>

		<td>We watched seabirds pirouetting in the distance, they've no problem in this wind. Their movements are sharp and fast. We don't know what kind of bird they are, they're brown with a white stomach. We've noticed the automatic bilge pump kept going off, we think there's a leak below the waterline and it is worrisome. We tried to find where it was, but found nothing. I suspect it may be the rudder post that is leaking, but for now it is impossible to look as I'd have to get into the cockpit locker, which is full of water bins and other gear. For now, we try and check the bilge often, pumping the water out by hand every 2h or so. We have two manual bilge pumps, one in the cockpit and another in the cabin under the sink. The automatic bilge pump doesn't empty the bilge entirely, as it sits on a little stand above the lowest point, but the manual pump tube touches the bottom and does a better job of sucking up the majority of the water. If anything, the automatic pump serves as an alarm.</td>

		<td>Devine was steering outside and gybed accidentally, as that happened the block for the boom preventer broke and the line caught one of the stanchions and bent it at a 45 degree angle. We thought it'd been ripped off the deck at its base, glad that wasn't the case. No damage to boom or main.</td>

		<td>We both did shorter night shifts because of the weather. Everything inside is wet, the floors are slippery with water and our foul-weather gear just isn't drying between shifts. We hang them over the sink so they drip into it, which makes doing the dishes a very complex and unpleasant affair. All synthetic clothing won't dry, and does a poor job of keeping us warm, we switch to wool as it stays warm even when damp.<br /><br />We still only eat two small meals per day, but at least we aren't low on energy. The terrible weather has a way of keeping us focused, when there is danger we become superhuman, we need less sleep, less food...less everything. Don't know how long we can sustain this though, I worry.</td>

		<td>THE SUN! THE SUN! We put things out to dry in the cockpit, well, ALL of it! As the wind and waves were down, we spent time dealing with minor breakages aboard, fixing leaks... also the anchor fell off the bow this morning, after time spent bashing in the waves. This is bad. We could hear banging outside of the front of the boat, not because it was banging on the hull, but it was the sound of it hitting the water and reverberating up the chain. I went ahead to pull it back up, the bow diving deep. I was drenched with salt water. I managed to get it up, and secured it as well as I could. This trip is a true test</td>

It drifts past us, its head out of the water, I also see its shell. Far off in the distance, I see the spray from a whale. Ah, calm days are wonderful, we see and hear so much more.</td>

		<td>We added a 3rd reef in preparation for coming bad weather, as it is easier to set up in calm conditions. A main with a 3rd reef also flaps a lot less in light winds. We're lucky so far, that none of our slides have broken off. In the last two trips we had many problems with this. I replaced the slides with nylon ones with stainless steel inlaid, they are stronger, better quality overall. Our old ones were all nylon and did not last. I know it is better for the slides to break rather than the main, but in our case, the main is very strong and won't split easily, also, replacing slides at sea is really, really hard and dangerous. I'd rather they not break. We both wish we had an outside track on the mast, the main would go up and down easily, and replacing slides would be easy.</td>

		<td>Clear night, we can see the stars. I am bored tonight, and so I do shadow puppetry using the light from the compass. We replaced the original light with an LED, but it shines so bright that it lights up the entire cockpit, acting as a stern light. We're going to have to replace this, as it is difficult to see the light of ships with it on, it is blinding.</td>

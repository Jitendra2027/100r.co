Rekka was working in an animation studio, and Devine, in a company that makes language learning tools. On weekends and evenings, we worked on our first two games: <a href='https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/hiversaires' target='_blank' class='external'>Hiversaires</a> and <a href='http://oquonie.100r.co' target='_blank' class='external'>Oquonie</a> (the latter was completed in Thailand).</p><p>After we returned to Canada in 2014, we decided that we wanted to keep moving, and so we looked at our options. Moving to a new country meant selling all we had, we'd done this countless times already, but we thought it wasteful. We then heard of people living on sailboats. We watched videos by <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF9TNM9R-iw'>David Wellsford</a>, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkaH_UUH0Ek'>Teresa Carey</a> and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkYfFeySHGN4DPrOc9So7PA'>Nike Steiger</a>, and became obssessed with the idea. Lack of experience aside, we thought that traveling was a good catalyst for learning new languages, for developing an interest in foreign cultures and ultimately for building empathy, curiosity, and creativity, traits that we will need to foster, as a species, if we want to survive the years to come.</p><p>In January 2016, we left the cold of Montreal and moved west to British Columbia. There, we purchased <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Pino/blob/master/README.md' target='_blank'>Pino</a> — keep in mind, we were a pair of city kids with limited outdoor experience, neither of us had ever stepped onto a sailboat before. That, did not deter us. We learned on the go, reading books and asking questions to other sailors on the docks.</p><p>Our curiosity then led us to make our first trip out to sea, which escalated into a circumnagivation of the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Our experiences at sea has changed how we work, and how we think. We are not professionals, nor do we claim to know everything about sailing, or about living aboard a boat. The information we share on this website and in our videos isn't solid truth, it's what we've learned, and is subject to change as we, ourselves, grow and learn. We neither know nor think that we know. To hear more about our story, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW32yUEymvU&feature=youtu.be' target='_blank' class='external'>listen to the talk</a> we did at XOXO in 2019.</p><p class='quote'>'A boat, for all its complexity, is in fact a version of simplicity, but of a satisfyingly complex kind.' - Adam Nicolson</p>");

	"<p>For every traveling sailor, comes a time when the boat has to stay alone in a foreign country. For us, this happened this year in <a href='sailing_in_japan.html'>Japan</a>. We'd never left <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a> alone before, never for more than a week. We were apprehensive at first, but decided it would be a good learning experience, for us and our beloved.</p>"
	"<p>Whenever we mentioned leaving our boat in Japan, people would say, \"Aren't you afraid of typhoons?\" Our 6 month leave coincided with the time of year when typhoons affect Japan, with August to October being the worse months. We were worried, but knew that if we prepared well, Pino would be fine. We spent weeks planning our departure, doing research on how to keep a boat safe in a storm, but also, how to keep mold and insects at bay in our absence.</p>"
	"<p>While in Canada, I had anxiety at night, vivid dreams about what was happening to Pino. These dreams involved us returning to the boat, only to find it turned into a moldy, water-logged cockroach motel. Having no experience leaving our home behind, I had no guarantee that we had done enough.</p>"
	"<p>When we returned 6 months later, we found no mold, no bugs and little to no damage, in fact, we slept in that same night. Pino endured weeks of hot Japanese summers, tropical rain and typhoon-strength winds. We're happy to say that overall, our preparations were indeed enough.</p>"
	"<p>Below is a short list of things to remember, things we learned, when came time to prepare our boat for long-term storage:</p>"
	"<ul class='bullet'><li>Ventilation is key.</li><li>Clear the decks.</li><li>Don't keep food.</li><li>Clean everything.</li><li>Store away everything.</li><li>Don't leave openings.</li><li>Tie everything down.</li></ul>");
add_part(&typhoons_and_mold, "ventilation",
	"<p>Summers in Japan are hot and humid, with temperatures reaching as high as 36°C. In early summer, we left Pino to visit friends in Tokyo for a week. When we came back, we found mold on the walls, and over clothes we'd left lying around. This happened because our boat was closed up too tightly. There was moisture present, and no airflow to prevent the growth of mold and mildew.</p>"
	"<p>We have four dorades, but for a boat sitting unattended, dorade boxes do <a href='https://www.liveabout.com/keep-your-boat-dry-and-prevent-mildew-2915362' class='external' target='_blank'>not result in enough air exchange by themselves</a> to prevent moisture buildup. To remedy this, we installed two fans to keep the air moving, one at the bow and one at the stern.</p>"
	"<p>We considered getting fans from a marine store, but we abandoned that idea because the models we saw were very, very expensive. And so instead we visited <a href='https://www.komeri.bit.or.jp/'>Komeri</a>, our local hardware store, and purchased two Panasonic exhaust pipe fans. Being at a marina, we had access to shore power, which meant we could have powered fans.</p>"
	"<img src='../media/blog/typhoons/08.jpg'/>"
	"<p>For the summer, we made a custom screen door for the companionway, and installed the first fan in it. It allowed air to flow in and out through the screen, and the powered fan would help it along.</p>"
	"<p>You left your boat unattended with only a screen door? Yes. Theft is very uncommon in Japan, and our marina is a 30-minute walk to the nearest town, which has a small population consisting mainly of elderly people. The marina has staff onsite most days, and at night, the paths are also guarded by the resident deers and wild boars.</p>"
	"<img src='../media/blog/typhoons/09.jpg'/>"
	"<p>To make sure water wouldn't come in through the screen, we attached a piece of canvas from the top of the sliding hatch door, held at an angle, with its 2 bottom corners attached to separate points. We stitched a pocket at the bottom of the piece of canvas, and slid an old mainsail batten in it. Keeping the canvas at an angle kept the rain off, while allowing air to flow. The canvas stayed put, even after the passage of typhoon Faxai(cat 4) and super typhoon Hagibis(cat 5).</p>"
	"<p>We installed a second fan in the head, near the bow. This fan would suck the air out. With two fans installed, the air would enter from one end and exit from the other.</p>"
	"<p>Our head was previously equipped with a solar fan, an accessory ill-suited for offshore waters. It came with the boat. Waves that washed over the deck would sometimes come spilling inside through it, drenching whoever was unlucky enough to be in the head at that moment. One day, after a boisterous sail, we discovered the fan motor had corroded, and so we removed it. We filled the gap in the ceiling with a spare deck plate we had onboard. Our plan was to install a temporary fan, with more pieces sourced from Komeri.</p>"
	"<img src='../media/blog/typhoons/02.jpg'/>"
	"<p>Komeri supplies goods for houses, not boats, but we found suitable candidates. We bought a vent — with a dorade-like shape — which fit our deck plate hole. We also purchased a corner pipe which would connect to the vent from inside, and the fan would fit into the mouth of the corner pipe. A perfect fit. This setup, while clunky-looking, worked well. We added foam around the pipe to stabilize it, and to stop water from coming inside.</p>"
	"<p>When we left, we opened the head door, and attached a bungee cord to the handle, keeping it propped open to allow air to pass.</p>"

add_part(&typhoons_and_mold, "food",
	"<p>Food on a sleeping boat is a buffet for insects. They will be more than happy to feast on whatever you leave behind.</p>"
	"<p>In warm climates, weevils can spawn from grains, beans and seeds. <a href='https://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/weevils-on-stored-grain' target='_blank'>Infestation-prone products</a> include wheat, corn, macaroni, oats, barley, sorghum, kaffir seed, and buckwheat. To prevent unwanted lodgers, we ate up most of our grains, beans and seeds and dumped the rest. We stored the less-problematic items — like gluten flour and nutritional yeast — in glass or sealed containers.</p>"
	"<p>Adding oxygen absorbers (powdered iron oxide packets) to the jars is a good way to keep products free of moisture, we didn't do this, but will next time.</p>"
	"<p>On a boat, canned products are common. We had cans left over from our time in New Zealand and Fiji. We inspected the cans, and discarded the ones with too much rust, the rest, we stored in a sealed plastic bin. We had previously removed the tags from the cans, marking the contents in permanent marker. But despite all our preparations, we made mistakes. I later opened several cans labeled as 'beans' which turned out to be 'mushrooms' — Woops! Mindfulness is key when labeling cans. We had to rethink our meal — not a big deal. The incident made us laugh, we wondered what else was falsely tagged as mushrooms.</p>");

	"<p>Removing all items from the deck ensures that nothing will go missing, it's also a way to keep our gear safe from wear and chafe. We removed our sails, hosed them down and left them to dry. We knew the sails had to be completely dry on both sides before being refolded and stowed. If the sails were stowed while still partially wet, mold and mildew could develop. Lacking a space on land to stow them, we put both sails in the v-berth.</p>"
	"<p>Washing lines, prior to stowing them, will extend their life. We washed all of our lines, soaking them for a few hours, and rinsing them out in several changes of fresh water. They stayed outside to dry, hanging from the lifelines. When completely dry, we found a spot for them in our cockpit locker to keep them out of the sun.</p>"
	"<p>We removed as much of our running rigging as we could, but lacking time we had to leave some of the halyards in. In an ideal world, all of them should have been removed, and replaced with sacrificial lines. Removing halyards is no easy task. The way to do this without incident, is <a href='https://captnmike.com/2013/06/04/washing-your-sheets-halyards-and-lines/' target='_blank'>to stitch a messenger line</a> to one end of the halyard, to make it easier to run them back in. It's hard to check the condition of a halyard while in the mast, but taking them off for storage is a good time to do it. While doing this, we noticed that our main halyard would need replacing next season.</p>"

	"<p>When Typhoon Krosa brushed by Shikoku, its effects reached as far north as Mie. The day before the storm, we saw other yachties preparing their boats, and we watched what they did. Many of the boats in the marina have no dodgers (being racing boats), but the ones that had them kept them up, and opened the front flap. We mirrored their preparations. When in doubt, do like the locals. Our dodger suffered no damage. We put extra lines on it to as a precaution. We removed both of our lee cloths, washing them before rolling them up and stowing them.</p>"

Tip: For better results, <a href='https://extension.colostate.edu/docs/pubs/foodnut/kitchen-sanitize.pdf' target='_blank'>heat the vinegar</a> prior to use. If heating the vinegar isn't an option, let it sit on the surface for 10 minutes before wiping it off.</p>"
	"<p>Washing the cushion covers was a long, but necessary step. The settee cushions have covers with zippers, but are held down by buttons that are stitched on. These buttons give the cushions a better shape, but given the fact they'd begun to rust, we cut them off and discarded them. We removed all covers, and hand washed them in warm soapy water. We washed them by hand because we feared that they would shrink, and let them dry in the sun.</p>"
	"<p>The cushioned back rests were tricky to remove. They double as doors to lockers, and to clean them, we had to unscrew and remove all 6 doors. It had to be done. It was work, but it gave us the opportunity to inspect and oil the hinges and ball catches.</p>"
	"<p>Winters in Mie aren't too cold, so we didn't think it necessary to winterize our engines (outboard, inboard and generator). Before we left, we filled the main diesel tank and added stabilizer — something we do on every fill up. Stabilizer displaces water, should there be moisture in the piping or elsewhere. We closed the raw water intake valve, and shut the diesel intake. For our outboard engine, we removed the left over gas, added a new batch along with some stabilizer. Adding STA-BIL will keep the gas fresh for up 12 months. Another step, was to change the oil, we did the same to our gas generator.</p>");

I soaked the affected tools in a tub of white vinegar for a few hours. The acetic acid in vinegar reacts to the rust, forming a layer on the metal. After soaking, I wiped the rust away and let the tool dry completely. I then added a light coating of WD-40, and stowed ALL tools in the Pelican case.</p>"

Many products ship with silica gel packets, it's easy to accumulate and re-use them. They lose absorbency over time, but it's possible to recharge them by heating the silica in the oven. Camphor tablets are excellent at absorbing moisture, and double as a means of keeping both rust and insects at bay. The tablets undergo a process known as sublimation, starting from a solid state to a gaseous state without an intervening liquid state — in other words, they slowly melt away, leaving no mess. To extend the life of camphor tablet, don't unwrap them, leave them wrapped in the cellophane, and with a pocket knife or a screwdriver, pierce the wrapper.</p>"

Bamboo charcoal is hygroscopic, taking in 3-5X more water than regular charcoal. We purchased 5 bags through a supplier in Japan, and placed these at various key points in the boat: one with the sails in the v-berth, one aft, one in the head and the other two on lockers in the saloon. These bags last a long time, but we'd read that to increase absorption, it's important to air them out. On our return, we laid the bags out on deck for a few hours. While absorbing water in the air, charcoal also acts as a deodorizer.</p>"
	"<p>To further decrease moisture levels in the cabin, we bought a large 10 kg bag of calcium chloride. Like bamboo charcoal, CH is a desiccant, and does a good job of drawing in water from the air. We bought some stockings at the convenience store, 3 in all, filled them with calcium chloride and went to hang them around the boat with 3 buckets sitting underneath them. We put one in the head, another at the foot of the mast and another near the engine room. We secured the buckets, to make sure they wouldn't tip over and spill their contents.</p>");

	"<p>To protect the forward hatch from the sun, we fitted a piece of canvas to it. The piece of canvas covered the hatch, with the four corners attached to webbing leading to separate points on the toe rail. We stitched the ends of the webbing to the toe rails for added strength. For the hatch behind the mast, we used an old piece of foam-backed aluminum, and taped it up with the reflective side facing up. This would keep the sun out, and protect it from debris.</p>"
	"<p>After changing the gas, oil and adding STA-BIL, our outboard returned to its perch on our aft rail. To protect it from the sun, we purchased a bike basket cover, a product sold in hardware stores in the bicycle accessories section. The shape fit our outboard well enough, but we tied ropes around the head to make sure the wind wouldn't take it, as it wasn't THAT well-adjusted.</p>"

	"<p>After everything on deck was secured, came time to think about keeping the boat tethered to the dock. Our marina was well protected, but was opened from the West. A passing typhoon, we knew, could generate big waves. To prevent damage to the boat, we purchased two <a href='https://www.pbo.co.uk/gear/pbo-tested-12-mooring-snubbers-45131' target='_blank'>Unimer wraparound snubbers</a> for our pre-spliced double-braided dock lines. We ran a long nylon 3-strand line on the deck to use as a spring line, with the workings ends running through chocks on the bow and stern, and tied with a bowline to a dock cleat. The nylon lines, like snubbers, stretch and absorb shock in the event that waves did come into the marina. We doubled all of our lines, for safety, and placed as many fenders as we could between the dock and the boat.</p>"

We couldn't do this for the aft dorades, so we bought some stockings and slipped them over top. This does reduce airflow, but it's better than leaving them open.</p>"
	"<p>A big problem, was our companionway door. It wasn't insect-proof. The sliding hatch rests forward of the doors, but has a gap on the sides. When we left Pino, we stuffed bits of foam into the cracks from outside.</p>"
	"<p>When staying in Japan, come July, we noticed some intruders aboard Pino... gokiburi (cockroaches). We were used to keeping the doors open on warm summer nights, but this was something we couldn't do here. Cockroaches are everywhere in Japan, the climate is perfect for them. Our boat was docked near the main ramp, making it easier for them to make their way over from land. We chose this spot in the marina because it provided the best protection, while ideal in the event of a typhoon, it wasn't great for insects. We picked our battle. The best thing to do, as the previous section suggested, was to leave no openings. We bought capsules with boric acid, to try and lure out the ones camping aboard, but this proved ineffective. What did work, was putting up little roach motels. I wrote about these motels in another post, if interested, read about it <a href='a_home_for_pino.html#gokiburi_hoi_hoi'>here</a>.</p>"
	"<p>When we left, we bought some extra motels, and scattered them at key points around the boat. When we returned aboard 6 months later, all traps were empty. No lodgers. We think this was because there was none aboard when we left, and that they weren't able to sneak inside afterwards. We used no sprays, but did buy cedar balls and scattered those in all cupboards. If we were to do this again, we'd replace cedar balls with camphor tablets, as they're supposedly better at repelling critters.</p>"

add_part(&typhoons_and_mold, "mistakes",
	"<p>In the beginning of this post, I mentioned that this was our first time leaving Pino alone. Even after doing a lot of research, we still made mistakes. In that last week, we had unexpected problems which slowed us down, and then there was the sweltering heat, which slowed our progress even more. Our minds were buzzing with information. We had to make sure we packed our suitcase, while ensuring all Pino-related tasks were taken care of, while practing our upcoming XOXO talk, that last one occupied a great deal of space in our heads. Overall, we did a good job, but we can always do better. Here's what we did wrong:</p>"
	"<p><b>Not asking for help</b>. Our biggest failure was not asking anyone to water our batteries. Yep, we did it again. We have a poor track record when it comes to taking care of our lead acid batteries. This essential task escaped our minds. It shouldn't have, but it did. We returned to Pino 6 months later to find the house batteries were near-dry. The plates were exposed. We watered them on arrival, and did not see any build-up on the plates, but we have to assume that there was some damage.</p>"
	"<p><b>Using a wrong fuse</b>. I mentioned before that we were struggling to finish tasks on the last day, the heat was one of the culprits, and the other was our automatic bilge pump. We forgot to test it earlier, and discovered it wasn't working. We saw that the fuse had blown, and noticed some corrosion around the casing. The fuse we put in wasn't the right voltage, and we had none to replace it with. Luckily, the harbormaster had one that he gave us — phew. We replaced some of the wiring, as well as the casing, and added the correct fuse. If we hadn't checked, this would have been disastrous for Pino. We would have returned to a flooded boat. Always check your bilge pumps are working.<p>"
	"<p><b>Not cleaning the freshwater tank</b>. Emptying and cleaning the water tank is necessary when leaving the boat alone for a long time. We emptied it, but our tank never empties out completely because the drain isn't at the lowest possible point. To run it dry, we needed to wipe the pooling water with rags. In an ideal world, we would have cleaned, and dried it afterwards. We didn't do this. This was a task reserved for the last day, but then the bilge pump issue happened. We left this task unfinished, and left feeling rather guilty, knowing that it might cause problems on our return. When we got back, we opened the tank and saw no growth, this may have been because we routinely treat the water with bleach, although I'm not sure that this was what prevented it. I flushed out the tank anyway, adding more bleach, giving it a good clean before re-filling it again.</p>"
	"<p><b>Forgetting bags of food</b>. In our last day rush, we forgot vacuum-sealed bags of cornmeal and buckwheat at the bottom of a locker. Luckily, these bags spawned no weevils.</p></p>"
	"<p><b>Buying hard-to-remove snubbers</b>. We've never been docked anywhere long enough to need dock line snubbers. In Japan though, it's essential. We bought two Unimer wraparound snubbers for our lines, but failed to see how difficult they'd be to remove. Removing lines from this type of snubber is very difficult. I had to do it to re-adjust their position on the line, and it was a very unpleasant experience. Purchasing Unimer U-cleat, while more expensive, would have been a better choice, as it's likely we'll be taking the snubbers on and off a lot.</p>");

	"<p>Storing a boat in a foreign country requires a lot of planning, work, patience and creativity. All in all, Japan is a good place to leave a boat, we don't regret doing it. While in the marina, the harbormaster and yard workers kept their eyes on Pino, they even sent us photos of our boat after a big typhoon passed through.</p>"
	"<p>The reason we left Pino was because we wanted to spend another season in Japan. Now, we can say that it was worth it, it's an amazing place to return to after months of absence. It was worth the trouble. Would we do it again? If we have to, yes, and this time, we'll take better care of our batteries.</p>");

There was 126nm between us and Shima Yacht harbor, a distance we needed to do in part at night. This wasn't ideal. We knew that. Many people warned us about sailing at night in these waters, but as the Japanese say: 'Shoganai' (it is what it is!). We needed to cross a big stretch of water called Enshu Nada, an area with a lot of traffic. In truth, the entire coastline is full of ships, but it gets very busy north of the Kii Peninsula.</p><p>We left Shimizu on a sunny morning, pushing off the dock at 6am. We discussed our plans with our friends Masa and Shu from Dawntreader, they too recommended a non-stop trip because the ports between Omaezaki and Mie are few. There is the port of Fukuda 福田, located at the mouth of Ota Kawa, but the depth of the water is  inconsistent and prone to silting. Locals also warned us it wasn't very yacht-friendly, and so we put an X on Fukuda.</p><p>Shu instructed us to stay 10nm from shore, to avoid the many nets lining the coast, and to avoid small fishing vessels idling there at night. We did as told.</p><p>Coming out of Shimizu port, we came face to face with a large container ship named 'One'. A beautiful ship. Red, with a peculiar shape. The marina had warned us about its coming, that its entrance into Shimizu port was scheduled at 6am during our exit. Avoiding it was not a problem.</p><p>We powered out of the harbor and into Suruga Bay. There was no wind, but we raised the mainsail anyway. We wanted to test our new slugs (what keeps the mainsail attached to the mast). It was the first time since Fiji that we'd raised a full main. The black moon shook off its wrinkles, presenting its belly to the sun.</p>");

This makes it difficult to go west, since the strong winds come out of where we need to go. During that transition between seasons, we saw daily forecasts of 40 knots, without end.</p><img src='../media/blog/minami_1.jpg'/><p>We eventually found our window.</p><p>We moved past ships idling in the waters next to Miho, pointing our bow towards Omaezaki. As we motored on, we remembered our arrival in mainland Japan a few weeks prior. There were white caps everywhere. Today, the sea had few ripples, it was calm, mirror-like. Mount Fuji's snowed-in peak was visible. It faded gradually as we moved south, veiled by a blanket of dust and humidity.</p><img src='../media/blog/minami_2.jpg'/><p>By the time we rounded Omaezaki, light escaped the world and gave way to darkness. Many Japanese sailors we spoke to admitted hating night-sailing. We used to feel that way too — funny how things change. Night-sailing is relaxing. You see the stars on clear nights, ships too, a triangulation of lights describing their shape. During our shifts we kept an eye on the horizon, there were many ships, all around at all times. If near enough to us, we'd open our phones to check their positions on AIS. AIS permits us to see their course and whether or not there is a chance of collision, with it we always had plenty of time to diverge from their tracks. There are times where we'd pass between them, sandwiched in the middle. This sounds worse than it is. We were at a comfortable distance. Most ships we encountered were a 100 feet long, smaller than cargo ships, Japanese tankers, ferrying goods up and down the coast of Japan.</p><img src='../media/blog/minami_3.jpg'/><p>Come morning, the wind came and filled the sails. There was a good breeze coming out of Ise Bay, rising to 15-20 knots at times. <a href='https://www.noforeignland.com/home/boat/4733784360484864/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1557534132049' target='_blank' class='external'>Pino</a> made good speed.

I had placed markers on Navionics, of the locations of newer nets, some I had researched online or grabbed off google earth screenshots.</p><p>When the marina was in sight, I sent a message to the harbormaster Mr. Oka. The marina manager at Hagoromosan marina had alerted Mr. Oka of our plans to visit earlier.

We slid past rows of moored boats, nets of aosa seaweed and made our way over to the dock. Mr. Oka took our lines and welcomed us to Mie, our new home.</p><p>This marina was home to the VOC 'Vivre Ocean Club', we spotted a few boats with the name on their stern. Most sailors in Japan are racers, you can tell by the design of the boats. They take their boats out on weekends in the spring and summer, showing their guests of the moment a good time, they also take part in local races.</p><p>The marina wasn't crazy big, but there was plenty of room for visiting boats, in fact, most boats we saw had a double slip to themselves with their lines securing their yacht to the opposing finger. Most of the boats here were sailboats, with a few motor boats scattered around. This marina was open to the west, by means of a channel, but a concrete pier blocks out most of the entrance, shielding boats who lie east of it. The marina was equipped with a boatyard with a trailer-lift, it had showers, internet, washer (shitty dryer) and power/water at the docks.</p><p>In our best Japanese, we explained to Mr. Oka of our plans to stay here for a month. He didn't mind that at all. Some marinas in Japan don't allow visitors to stay longer than 7 days in a month, we're glad that this rule didn't apply here. Their monthly rates were good, nothing like the prices at Hagoromosan marina. The staff here was relaxed and friendly, no one asked us to pay up front. All said hello as we walked past. Seeing as we were staying longer, Mr. Oka directed us to a new berth, a spot with Pino's butt facing toward the open west. We had a wonderful scene ahead, with no boat or dock obstructing our view.</p><img src='../media/blog/minami_16.jpg'/><p>Tobi (black-eared kites) circled overhead, their feather fingers like large open hands hugging the skies. These birds are a common sight in Japan. They fly with ease and turn with precision. We'd see them soaring overhead, resting on mastheads in the marina. They have a distinctive shrill whistle followed by a rapid whinnying call — a sound we came to love.</p>The marina had clear waters, was surrounded with trees and was quiet, so, so quiet.

We walked to town on the day we arrived, under a grey sky and light rain, we wanted to explore right away. The road, initially, has a lot of ups and downs, then it branches out onto a bigger road, adjoining the towns at the end of the peninsula to the main roads in Gokasho. On the way, was an open garden. In spring, butterflies would swarm the area, some as big as birds, but now, was caterpillar season with many hanging down trees from long threads. We'd always end up with a couple on our heads and shoulders as we walked.</p><p>A day after we arrived we got a visit from two customs agents. They asked us a few questions in Japanese.</p><ul><li>'Why are you here?'</li><li>'For fun.'</li></ul><p>In truth, we were here to just... be here.

They couldn't understand why we wanted to stay here.</p><ul><li>'You know there's no karaoke here....right?'</li></ul><p>We don't care about that stuff, at all. For us, here was ideal, a good place to get things done. We had projects to work on, a quiet area like this would help us focus. We wondered if we'd be bombarded with Omotenashi from the locals here too, we did, a bit, but it wasn't nearly as invasive as in Shimizu. When I say invasive, I don't mean to say I didn't appreciate it, but it was a bit much at times.</p><p>Mr. Oka was quick to introduce us to Kako and Hiro san, two local sailors and full-time cruisers — a rarity in Japan. Another plus, is that they both spoke very good English. While we like to practice our Japanese, we can't really go in-depth on certain topics. We were able to do that with them, it was a nice change!</p><p>The two have many boats in the marina, 3 in all. Their main yacht is in France. They spend a few months cruising there, then return to Japan, they've been doing this for a few years. They own two houses here in Minamiise, two wonderful properties with amazing views. One of them has a window looking over the entrance to Gokasho bay, when we came sailing in Kako saw us.</p><ul><li>'Black circle yea! I saw you!'</li></ul><p>Kako said, smiling.</p><p>The two were kind enough to invite us over for dinner, they made a wonderful all-plant meal for us. Kako steamed some tiny taro roots and made delicious rice with young bamboo and fresh sanshou leaves (they had a tree outside). She also cooked some tempura, some of the best I've ever had. Hiro insisted on driving us back, even if the marina was only a short walk away...</p><ul><li>'The forest is dark, there are wild boars and deer here. Don't want to get trampled.'</li></ul><p>We nodded, my mind conjuring images of giant boars 'princess mononoke style'. We never did see boars, but in evenings, there are deer everywhere. Walking around at night is scary, there is little light, and plenty of rustling in the trees.</p><ul><li>'Ya ok, a ride sounds good.'</li></ul><p>Both left to go back to France after that.

All the nicer houses had this.</p><p>The town of Gokasho 五ヶ所 (a 30-40 min walk away) had many more homes, a few without owners — why so many empty homes? Japan has an aging population problem, with a growth rate that's going to bring its current population of ~127 million down to 88 million by 2065. Within 20 years more than one third of its residents will be 65 and older.</p><img src='../media/blog/minami_4.jpg'/><p>No one will live in many of these houses, ever again. They will be demolished someday, when/if they pose a threat — although it takes money to do that too and is why many are left standing. The bulk of the population in Japan chooses to reside in metropolitan areas. This is true for the old and the young, people aren't interested in making a life in rural areas. There are few businesses, and the few that there are, are seldom open and we fear that they too, will die with their owners.</p><p>We walked into a camera shop one day to try and get a film developed, the owner was asleep. Business was NOT booming.</p><img src='../media/blog/minami_7.jpg'/><p>We arrived in Mie in late winter with the weather being nice and cool, perfect for cycling. We explored much of the area, circling the small town of Gokasho and the neighboring town of Kirihara many times. Kirihara is north of Gokasho, a town with few stores, much of its land occupied by rice fields. At this point in the year, the fields were completely flooded with few plants sprouting. During our time here, the sprouts grew taller and taller, each stage marking the passage of time.</p><p>Minamiise isn't particularly known for its rice, but it is known for its fish and its seaweed. In late winter, we'd see locals drying out hijiki and selling their wares (like green aosa) in stores.</p><img src='../media/blog/minami_24.jpg'/><p>Even if we had the option of riding our bikes to town, we enjoyed walking there too. The road was quiet, few cars used it. Everytime we went out to walk, we'd spot a different creature on the bark of a tree, or scurrying across the road. During one of those walks we saw a mukade, a very large species of centipede that can grow up to 20 cm long. They had dark bodies, with the rest covered in bright oranges and reds — striking colors. The way their legs moved in perfect synchronous waves was hypnotic. While mukade were a rare sight, we'd see many crabs. All sorts.</p><img src='../media/blog/minami_18.jpg'/><p>The first time I saw a crab on land was in French Polynesia. At the time, I didn't know crabs could live in forests, in my mind, crabs only existed near water. There were many types of crabs on the roads here, jumping into crevasses as soon as you came near. I would sometimes see some in the marina bathroom stalls too...</p><ul><li>'You have strayed, do you know where you are little one?'</li></ul><p>I'd ask. In response, they'd inch deeper into the stall, eager to disappear. Devine claimed to have seen a Huntsman spider in here, a very large variety of spider. These, like mukade, are known to hunt cockroaches.</p>");
add_part(&a_home_for_pino, "Gokiburi hoi hoi", "<p>Another 'less fun' variety of insect found widely in Japan are cockroaches, or <b>gokiburi</b>（ゴキブリ）in Japanese. Japan's climate is ideal for gokiburi. As soon as winter ends, they emerge, and frighten entire households. It doesn't matter if your home is clean or not, if they find a crack in the door they'll get in. We weren't careful in the beginning, not aware of their presence, but soon realized we'd need to close every crack to avoid unwanted lodgers. Japan is no stranger to these creatures, with many products on the market to fight them. The most successful we tried being Gokiburi Hoihoi (ゴキブリホイホイ). The name makes me laugh. 'Hoi Hoi' means 'Shoo!', or 'Shoo shoo cockroaches!'</p><p>When you buy a box, you get a foldable 'house', a friendly motel, decorated with cute and colorful illustrations. A dream house for goki and friends. The house has a sticky flooring, as well as a bait inside it. On the first day I set up one of these outside in the cockpit, where they tend to linger and I caught 3 gokis. The next day, an extra two. Soon, the motel was fully booked. No vacancies.</p><p>I tried using capsules too as a first tactic, little domes with a deadly treat inside (boric-acid based), but the gokis didn't care for it.</p><p>While I loathe the sight of them near my home, gokiburi are an interesting breed of extremophiles. They can live without oxygen for 40 mins, without water for 1 week and without food for even longer! Their diet is varied. They share our interests in food, but if that isn't available they'll eat whatever else they can find. Anything. Everything is food: tile glue, toe-nail clippings, soap etc. They are true survivalists.</p><p>As much as I admire these pesky revenants though, I'd rather not find them in my kitchen.</p>");

One time we continued north up a forested road, but didn't go up all the way because we didn't know where it led. We weren't in the mood to get lost on that particular day. Later, we learned that this road was 30km long and leads all the way up to Ise, by way of the Ise Grand Shrine — the most popular attraction in Mie.</p><p>Perfect! We thought. We were eager to do a long bike ride. Not long after after that, we got up early one morning and cycled back over to Kirihara, going through the forested path and up what turned out to be a... 300m high mountain.</p><img src='../media/blog/minami_9.jpg'/><p>Yes. We cycled up this mountain on fixed-gear bikes. When we planned out this ride, we failed to notice the steep incline on google maps.

I cursed as I pedaled up the winding road, wondering if it would ever end, if it was anything like that endless staircase to Bowser's lair in supermario 64.</p><p>We did eventually make it up there. My bad mood and thoughts of dying went away, like a passing storm cloud.</p><img src='../media/blog/minami_21.jpg'/><p>There was a pass at the top of this mountain called 剣峠 (Tsurugi Toge), right where the city of Minamiise ends and the city of Ise begins. There's was sign at each end. We saw no one up there, maybe a car or two on the way but that's it. We did see one Kuroneko truck, weaving its way through the forest — a strange sight.</p><p>Cycling down the mountain was a welcome change, although it was very, very steep. My hands hurt from using my brakes too much, palms red and sweaty. Mid-way down, we encountered a woman with plastic bins, standing by the road.</p><img src='../media/blog/minami_8.jpg'/><p>She was filling them with water from a tap on the mountain wall.</p><ul><li>'Water. For sake.'</li></ul><p>She said, smiling. The water is filtered by the sediment in the mountain. It's very clean. We had a drink and continued on our way, passing through small collections of houses.

add_part(&tools_ecosystem, "Our tools", "<p>How did the Hundredrabbits ecosystem come into being? It's a long story, but here's a summary.</p><p>In 2016, we left Canada, armed with our two iPhones and 2 MacBooks Pros. We didn't know the wattage of any of the devices we owned,  and even less about the amount of solar needed to power them. When living on land we didn't pay attention to how many amps our devices required daily. Electricity felt limitless.</p><p>When we started sailing in BC, we had no dinghy and so we'd go from dock to dock. When we purchased Iggy in Nanaimo, we spent more days on the hook. The first anchorage we went to was a small bight east of Eagle Point, it offered a great view of metro Vancouver. From that point on we spent more and more time at anchor, moving every 5 days or so. We had no power concerns because our route always included marinas, or guest slips at yacht clubs. Our batteries were always topped up.</p><p>Life off-grid was new to us then, as was spending lots of time outdoors. We liked it, a lot. When at anchor we'd go explore, spend a few hours working, cooking, then we'd read or play card games in evenings. When living on land, we'd work from 8h-19h, sitting in front of our respective screens, but now things were different. We wanted to do less of that, to take long bike ride around islands or to sit on the deck in evenings to watch the sun set. Then, at marinas where we had both power and  internet, we'd go back to working longer hours to get things done. This was a fine setup, we thought, but, there was problem: what happens when we start living AND working at anchor full time? We liked being outdoors, but that's not all we wanted to do. We're creatives, and we need to make things. We were relying on powered docks to work, and so we never got to test our current power setup off-grid. If we had spent a month or so away from  civilization, we would have learnt that we had to change something.</p><p>And so, to continue with the story, we left Canada and cruised down the coast of the US. True to our old habits, we continued to alternate between staying in a marina and at anchor. The longest we spent off-grid during that time was 3 weeks in San Francisco, anchored off Treasure Island. During that time we discovered that working aboard, running two Macbook Pros, a refrigerator and our phones was not possible. To save on power, we started turning the fridge off at night, and taking trips into town during the day to work from cafes. SF was grey on most days, our solar couldn't keep up with our demanding work schedules. Going to work from cafes in town worked well for us, most had outlets we could use. Our routine started with working from cafes until lunch, then wandering around in the afternoons. We would return home before dark to turn the fridge off, but doing it didn't make sense because the constant shifts in temperatures produced too much moisture. Moisture meant rot and mold. We decided that keeping it off was a better idea for both our batteries and our produce. With the fridge out of the equation, we figured that we'd have more power left-over for our laptops.</p>");
add_part(&tools_ecosystem, "A dead Macbook", "<p>We experienced time at anchor again in San Diego, with Pino finding a cosy spot near Coronado island. All convenient anchorages were full because of the Baha Haha, an annual regatta of boats that sail down the coast to Mexico. Being near Coronado wasn't too bad, but our spot was far from the public dock. We didn't have an outboard motor then and had to row everywhere. Rowing wasn't easy in an inflatable. We wanted to bring our bikes onto shore, so we could cycle around San Diego, but the nearest drop off was a golf course. We rowed our bikes onto the shore, dropped them off and Devine sneaked them across the greens and into town while I rowed to the public dock. Everyday we'd row our laptops into town to work on our game Markl, trying to solve problems we had with the design of the game. At that point, we'd hit a wall with this project. We pushed on anyway, but could only work on it for 2 weeks because after that, we had to make our way south across the border.</p><p>The sail was nice and short, we arrived near Ensenada in the dark with plans to anchor off Islas de Todos Santos, a set of offshore islands. Anchoring anywhere in the dark is foolish, we knew it when we did it the first time in San Luis Obispo, and again that day. As we neared our anchoring spot, shapes began to appear in the dark. They were annoying to us because our guide told us they weren't supposed to be there, important to note that our Charlie's Charts guide was from the 70's and that even if landmasses don't move, human constructions spawn in and out of existence. The bay had aquaculture pens in it. Loads of them. This is something we would have seen had we looked at satellite images of the islands, but we didn't do this. We couldn't stay here, so we turned around and headed to Ensenada to find a place to anchor. We dropped anchor in another spot recommended by the ancient wisdom of Charlie's Charts, and so having struck nothing, we thought it safe and went to sleep.</p><p>We woke up the next morning with someone knocking on the hull. We climbed out, hair dishevelled, to see who it was, and saw 3 men in a power boat with 'policía' written on its side. Written Spanish is not too hard to decipher for French speakers like us, but verbal Spanish is something else entirely. I caught bits of what they were trying to communicate to us. Words like 'hora', which in my mind sounded like 'hours' which meant they were asking us about the time? What they were actually saying was 'ahora', meaning 'now', as in... we have to move NOW because a large cruiseship is coming and we're anchored in its path. 70's Charlie's Charts did not take this into account. Shame on them. How dare they not know the future?</p><p>We found a spot at Baja Naval, a marina with power on the dock. After spending 3 days there, we decided to book it for a month so we could have time to work on projects. The timing was impeccable, because my Macbook Pro started having logic board issues. We had few options for repair at the time, and we couldn't afford to replace it. We had a Chromebook aboard Pino, a laptop we bought to use as a media station. Since we were a laptop short, Devine decided to try and use <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAmGmuUEhww' target='_blank' class='external'>ChromeOS for development</a>. During this transition, Devine developed the first version of <a href='ronin.html' target='_self' class='local'>Ronin</a>. I didn't have Photoshop to work with, but we wondered if we could fashion a replacement for it ourselves. Ambitious, I know. Our thinking was that we could only implement the features we needed. Devine used PS for simple photo manipulation like color correction, and I needed brush tools and layering. We didn't use most of the features included with the software, so building a lean graphics editor would be easy... right?</p>");
add_part(&tools_ecosystem, "Ronin", "<p>The early version of Ronin we designed was functional, but it couldn't serve as a replacement for Photoshop. Not yet. We still had too much to learn. </p><img src='../media/blog/ecosystem_5.jpg'/><p>At this point, we were in trouble. A friend in SF heard about our problems and sent us an old disused 17' Macbook. We couldn't believe it. I could use it while we worked at improving Ronin. This gratious donation solved our problem.</p><p>We sailed around Baja California and over to La Paz in the Sea of Cortez. The marinas in La Paz, like the ones in San Diego, were full-up because of the same people. People sail down to Mexico, find a spot and stay there forever. We had no choice then, we started to live at anchor full time. We anchored off La Paz in the main anchorage, a short dinghy ride away from shore. This new setup worked for a while, but my new-to-me laptop was a battery-draining vampire, drawing ~8ah per hour. We couldn't work from Pino. We had to go back to old habits and seek help in the form of a coffee shop. This strategy worked in most places we'd been so far, but in La Paz, we found no cafe with both outlets and internet. We needed both to work, my hungry Macbook demanded it. To offer our solar panels some relief, we got a gas generator. Not the greenest of options, but it was the only way we'd found to keep working aboard Pino. Also, we figured it could be handy if ever we needed to use power tools at anchor. The gas generator combined with our engine's alternator worked for us. We'd sail to far away anchorages in Mexico and could stay working there for days and days without worry. The only reason we'd go back to town was to get food.");

Most times, I could not charge my laptop up to full battery, which means that it drew a LOT of power all the time. On a laptop the last few percentage points are much lower wattage to float/top it off, but, I never got there with my Mac. To add to our growing list of difficulties, our resident vampire's battery stopped holding a charge. We couldn't use it.</p><p>When we arrived in the Marquesas, our problems only worsened. Our house batteries and solar couldn't keep up with the combined thirst of our computers. I could only use my computer when the sun was highest in the sky, for short periods of time. It proved to be impractical. We couldn't use Photoshop or Xcode, two softwares we needed to make our games. Our generator was a big help, but we didn't want to run it all the time. We used it every couple of days, ignoring the sound, smell and vibration. Not an ideal situation.</p><p>In Nuku Hiva we had no internet on the boat. If we wanted to do anything online, we had to take the dinghy to shore to work from an outdoor cafe. This place had bananas hanging from the ceiling, the air was thick with flies and the was floor covered in sleeping hounds. The internet connection was slow, faster in the morning when there were less people around using it, but still damned slow. One morning Devine was sitting at the cafe, struggling to update Xcode again. Discouraged. Across the table sat another person, another demoralized soul. This, was Herbert.</p><img src='../media/blog/ecosystem_6.jpg'/><p>Herbert, sweat at his brow, glared at the screen of his laptop. Devine sat across from him, beads of sweat trickling down as the speed of the internet slowed to a painful crawl. They sat there together, unaware that they shared a problem. Herbert, was a developer/sailor too, and was trying to download the same updates to Xcode. Both bonded over this struggle, which persisted throughout the South Pacific.</p><p>Making apps and games from an island in the Marquesas sounds idyllic. It's easy to imagine a developer smiling, one hand on the keyboard and the other holding a perspiring glass of pamplemousse juice, so pleased with his choices. 'AH! Dee-li-cious!' In truth, the developer can't enjoy his pamplemousse juice because he's too busy swearing at faraway bodies in Silicon Valley who think 10 G software updates are perfectly reasonable.</p><p>I remember us thinking then that our idea to work and travel was silly, impossible even, but we didn't give up. We had to find a way to continue to make things.</p>");
add_part(&tools_ecosystem, "Realizations", "<p>One night in Tahiti, we were sitting on deck, watching the Island of  Moorea in the distance. We talked about expectations versus reality, and made a list of things we could improve on. I wasn't working  much, due to my laptop's faulty battery, but this wasn't all bad... it  allowed for more swimming, and to dive back into former interests, like writing. I began to write more during that time, using the Chromebook because it was low-power. The Chromebook only had Caret as a writing  tool, which I was fine with, but Devine wasn't having it. The next day, he was hard at work making me a writing tool, something basic. The more I was writing, the more we improved it. Overtime, we added a synonyms dictionary, auto-complete and many other basic features, while keeping it lean. This, was our writing tool <a href='left.html' target='_self' class='local'>Left</a>.</p><p>When we arrived in New Zealand, even if we were near a big city, with resources, we still didn't have access to power. We would have to continue to rely completely on solar. We invested in <a href='raspberry.html' target='_self' class='local'>Raspberry Pi</a> hardware, to replace the ChromeBook. Our <a href='the_computer.html' target='_self' class='local'>new Pi setup</a> was low-power and low-cost, perfect for writing. I decided to no longer use the 17' Macbook, even with a replacement 3rd-party battery (which also failed us later on). The device was still a crazy power-hungry beast. We couldn't use devices like that on Pino, not anymore. It was at that time that we received yet another disused Macbook to add to our growing collection. This 2010 model was less power-demanding, and would help keep me keep working.</p><p>We knew then already, that we didn't want to buy a new-anything from Apple ever again. Combining parts to create a good-working computer was, at the time, our only viable option. We would keep using these laptops, repairing them any way we can until we could find them suitable homes. An estimated 130,000 computers end up in the garbage annually, we didn't want to add to those statistics. Greenhouse emissions in production are far higher than from several years worth of usage by customers. This is why we've been holding off on purchasing new devices (in an attempt at reducing our broader environmental impact). In today's climate, it is far better to re-use, than to buy. After these events, we became aware — and concerned — over our power consumption. Just like how we calculate our water intake with a foot pump (1/4 cup per push), we would start to monitor our power usage, and to try and find ways to lessen it. This, was beneficial to the environment, but also, our situation required it. With limitations comes creativity.</p><p>We too, began talking about our vision of the future, about what working on Pino could be like if we could lessen our dependence on software and hardware we couldn't fix ourselves.</p><p>As we pushed further and further west with Pino, we accumulated both miles and problems, strengthening our desire to be self-sufficient.</p><img src='../media/blog/ecosystem_1.jpg'/><p>Another downside we discovered, was that many tools and operating software need to call home eventually. It isn't uncommon for an iPhone to lock up, due to a prolonged period of no-internet. Many sailors we met also had that same problem. It's dangerous. Especially considering that many, like us, navigate using their phones. It's how we get our weather and communicate with others. We can view messages and weather downloaded with the SAT phone via an app on our cellphones.</p><p>We had a clear view of what we wanted then.</p>");

This, recently, has evolved into coding our websites in C99, a language that is more resilient and light. We're also learning to code in Assembly, with the hope of making our games playable on older hardware like the NES and famicom.</p><p>All in all, we want everything we do to be <b>open-source</b>, so that if something breaks, we can easily fix it.</p><p>In an ideal world, we'd also have devices of our own design which follow these same rules.

add_part(&hello_fujisan, "A detour to shimizu", "<p>It's 8h00 pm on a cold dark winter night, we are outside of Shimizu harbor motoring in circles and waiting for a response from Shimizu Port Control. The temperature is 4C, the wind is blowing hard and our clothes are wet and caked with salt. We’re tired and hungry, waiting for permission to enter the Port. Prior to this, we just had a very, very rough 4 day passage, riding under 30-40 knot winds on the nose. This passage was a true test of strength, for us and for <a href='https://www.noforeignland.com/home/boat/4733784360484864/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1557534132049' target='_blank' class='external'>Pino</a>, but first let’s go back and see exactly what happened…</p><p>We'd planned to go to Wakayama, riding on the back of a passing low with winds from the NE, shifting to the S and then to the SW, but the wind decided to turn earlier making it impossible for us to go east. We found ourselves close-reaching in 40 knot winds, heading straight north. Looking at the weather we could see that it would blow from the W for 3-4 days, so we made a new plan to head to Omaezaki. We'd read of other sailors taking refuge there in big weather and thought it would be possible to go, but again, the wind kept pushing us further and further east. The next port on our list was Shimizu, tucked in deep into the bay. We were able to point Pino to the cape just past Shimizu, but we weren't sure if again the wind and current would allow us to make some easting.</p><p>At that point both of us were frozen solid. Wave after wave splashed over the boat and into the cockpit. The starboard rail was constantly submerged, our starboard side lee cloth was gone and the diesel bins were threatening to fall overboard. We had 3 reefs in our main, but 5 slides had snapped off (yet again), I wondered when the rest would break. If we lost the use of our main going forward would be impossible.</p>");
add_part(&hello_fujisan, "Exhaustion at sea", "<img src='../media/blog/shimizu_11.jpg'/><p>Inside the cabin was also chaos. The joker valve of our toilet decided to stop working. Problems, we've learned, always come in pairs. Toilet water kept backflowing and because we were on a starboard tack — the toilet being on the high side — it all came spilling on the floor. We learned then too that the drain on the floor facing the toilet was clogged, so the toilet water began to accumulate there and the smell was horrid. We did close the toilet inlet valve, but the pipe is long and keeps a surprisingly large amount of water. The dorades too were leaking badly, we put the covers on and even flipped them around but water still came leaking out. Water is patient, if there's a crack it'll find its way in.</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_13.jpg'/><p>We couldn't stand inside the boat because of the extreme tilt. The floor was slippery, wet with salt water. Doing anything inside required much care. There was no comfortable place to be, aside from a settee where we slept. The lee cloth kept us from falling out. Although eventually water began to trickle down onto our warm cocoon from the ceiling. Alas, our last stronghold against the wetness had been breached.</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_24.jpg'/><p>We were both tired physically and mentally. We had no appetite, the smell of toilet didn't help.</p><p>We were in Sparta mode.</p><p>Both of us were scared we wouldn't make it. What if we couldn't make it to Shimizu? The port of Shimoda was next... but what if the wind didn't allow us to go there either? I imagined us getting pushed further and further east, past Shimoda, past Yokohama... and Tokyo. I wanted to believe we'd make it, but the last few days had been so horrible that it was hard to believe that things could be good again.</p><ul><li>'This whole sailing to Japan thing was a silly dream wasn't it? Why the hell did we think we could do this.'</li></ul><p>I wondered.</p><ul><li>'Pino, we're so sorry to have put you in this situation, you deserve better.'</li></ul>");
add_part(&hello_fujisan, "Shipping lane chaos", "<p>We were aiming for the point just east of Shimizu, with the blind hope of somehow being able to make some easting to get some shelter from the waves inside of the bay. The worse was yet to come, another danger lay ahead: a very busy shipping channel with cargo ships, fishing boats and other large vessels thundering up and down the coast at 10-15 knots. We had to cut through it to get to Shimizu. I swallowed hard, took a look at AIS to see if this was possible. We could see every ship, as well as their speed and if whether or not we were on a collision course. Our AIS alarm started beeping, signalling ships that are dangerously close, it did not stop beeping for many hours.</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_16.jpg'/><p>This felt like the scene in Gattaca, when a myopic Jerome has to cross a busy highway without being able to see. Jerome jumped into the traffic and somehow made it out alive. That is what it felt like to cross that shipping lane. Some cargo ships altered course for us, but not all would, or could do this. Devine was driving while I stared at the AIS screen, trying to work us through it all, lying to myself saying that everything was going to be okay. I was counting the number of nautical miles to go before we were in the clear. At that point I was also afraid that the mountains around us would cause the wind to change direction, we were close-reaching and barely making it inside the bay, if the wind had too much north in it we’d be pushed further east still and we’d miss our target.</p><p>Instead of the wind shifting north it eased to the W again and permitted us to sail into the bay. We thought we’d be shielded from the waves in there, but the bay was very open and we were still getting pounded. Devine & I took turns at the tiller, whenever we got too cold to drive we’d switch places. We didn't feel great then, but something was helping us along, making us feel better and giving us hope. That thing was the sight of Mount Fuji, rising majestically in the distance.</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_15.jpg'/>");
add_part(&hello_fujisan, "You cannot enter Shimizu Port", "<p>The port of Shimizu was 20 NM from the bay entrance, we were doing good speed but it didn’t seem like we’d arrive before sunset. The sun eventually slipped below the horizon, just as we were getting near the port entrance. We were planning on getting into the breakwater and to find a place to dock, any place, and to alert the authorities of our arrival in the morning. I didn't have the contact info for this port but was confident that they wouldn't have a problem with us being here, considering this was a force majeure. I knew there was a marina in there, I had a rough idea of its layout as well as coordinates of a safe dock. That was my plan, to work our way onto that spot. At this point we just wanted to have a foot on land, to be in a safe place. When we got near the breakwater we rolled in the jib and started the engine. Just as we were coming in, we heard a call on the radio...</p><ul><li>“Pino, Pino, this is Shimizu port radio.”</li></ul><p>This was our first time in a big Japanese port, we didn't expect anyone to hail us.</p><ul><li>“This is Pino.”</li><li>“What is your intention Pino.”</li><li>“We are going to Shimizu marina.”</li><li>“Do you have a local agent?”</li></ul><p>Neither of us knew what that meant — a local agent? I thought it may have been some mistranslation, we had the permits to get into any port in Japan. No one had ever told us anything about needing a local agent.</p><ul><li>“Hum, we don't have that.”</li><li>“Then I am sorry, you cannot enter Shimizu Port.”</li></ul><p>I froze. Devine & I were looking forward to resting and eating a proper meal for once, not just that, the sun was down and the night was very, very cold. I’d told Devine to not enter the harbor because we didn't have permission, he was driving Pino around in the circles in the quarantine area near the entrance while I was trying to sort this all out.</p><ul><li>“Our sail is damaged, we need a dock to make repairs!”</li></ul><p>I was getting desperate then, the fatigue of the last 4 days of sailing in rough weather was weighing me down.</p><ul><li>“You need a local agent. I will give you a number so you can call.”</li></ul><p>I groaned then.</p><ul><li>“I don’t have a phone number, I just got here!”</li><li>“Okay. Then you’ll need to speak to the Coastguard.”</li></ul>");
add_part(&hello_fujisan, "Devine saves the day", "<p>I called the coastguard on the radio then, but they were treating us like they would a large cargo ship. The questions she asked didn’t apply to us. When I tried to explain our situation she just apologized, I’d reached the limit of her English and she left the channel.</p><ul><li>“The FUCK was THAT!!”</li></ul><p>I was beyond angry at that point, frustrated by Japanese bureaucracy. I could hear Devine outside then...</p><ul><li>“The hell is going on?!”</li><li>“Coastguard hung up on me! They won’t let us into the port.”</li></ul><p>Devine was shivering violently and was also short on patience.</p><ul><li>“What? No way we're staying out here. Take the tiller, I’ll speak to them!”</li></ul><p>Devine was alternating speaking to the Shimizu port radio and the Coastguard. About 15 minutes later, Devine told me to head into port and gave me a set of coordinates.</p><ul><li>“We can bring Pino to this berth. They said it was next to a boat called Dawn Treader.”</li><li>'How the hell did you get permission?”</li></ul><p>Devine told them it was a force majeure, that we had repairs to do and that we had no other options. He also said that we had all the necessary papers and even gave them references of people we knew in Japan (contacts of other Japanese sailors we'd met in Ogasawara). All in all, we wanted to say the same thing but Devine said it in a way that was concise, important when dealing with people with English as their second language.</p><ul><li>“I said what they wanted to hear, that’s all. Got us in didn't I?”</li></ul><p>I have so much love for this human, and remember thinking how lost I'd be without him. Devine, my savior. Going back out there was not an option for us, we knew we couldn’t take another night at sea.</p><p>We motored past the breakwater and inside of the Port of Shimizu. The coordinates that they’d given us brought us to the marina, but not at a dock. We thought this was a mistake and so we circled around the marina a few times to try and find the boat named Dawn Treader — no luck. It was hard to see the names in the dark. We slipped into a random berth and decided to try and find the boat on foot. As soon as we docked, we got another call from the port radio.</p><ul><li>“You’re in the wrong slip.”</li></ul><p>They were keeping an eye on us with AIS and could see we weren’t where we were supposed to be. We’d assumed the coordinates were wrong, but in truth we’re the ones who’d messed up. The dock in question was a public dock, a concrete wall. We assumed it wasn’t a place where we could dock because there there was a large 100 foot yacht on it, with colored lights in the rigging. We didn’t think that this boat was Dawn Treader, it looked like a show-boat — they failed to tell us how big the boat was, in hindsight, we should have asked.</p>");
add_part(&hello_fujisan, "Japanese bureaucracy", "<p>We pushed away from the berth at the marina and found a place at the concrete wall, tying Pino up to a set of heavy bollards (35 0.632'N 138 29.699'E). This was the <a href='https://www.noforeignland.com/home/map/place/5332304654237696/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1557533878040' target='_blank' class='external'>Shimizu public dock</a>. As soon as tied up, we heard a call from Shimizu Port radio again.</p><ul><li>“You can stay there, but you cannot go to shore.”</li></ul><p>I looked at Devine, desperation mounting.</p><ul><li>“Well this just keeps getting better and better huh?”</li></ul><p>When we asked questions, they just said to stay on the boat and to not leave unless absolutely necessary. I was freaking out. We had repairs to make and we’d just arrived on mainland Japan...! This was our dream and we couldn’t step foot on land? We felt like criminals, or worse yet, prisoners. Both of us were depressed, frustrated with Japanese bureaucracy.</p><p>Japan had recently instated a cruising permit that made it possible for smaller boats — like us — to enter closed ports without having to ask for permission. We thought that this permit would allow us to go into anywhere, but now there was something going on that we didn’t understand. We hadn’t send a pre-arrival notice to this port, but we’d read that in an emergency — which it was — that we could enter any port, with the condition that we’d notify the coastguard as soon as possible. We’d spoken to the coastguard on arrival on the radio and still it seemed like it wasn’t okay for us to be here. We went to bed that night, shivering and sad, hoping that tomorrow would be better. Either way, being stuck here was better than beating into the waves and wind out there.</p><p>Early the next morning, we woke up to a clear sky and calm waters, with a view of Fujisan. We could see it rising out of horizon from our window, it was unreal.</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_26.jpg'/>");
add_part(&hello_fujisan, "A visit from Japanese officials", "<p>Now that it was daytime, we could see our new neighborhood better. We were next to a public area, with many tourists hanging around, camera in hand, to take pictures of Mount Fuji. It’s likely that Pino is present in many tourists photos, because we were moored right near a famous picture spot.</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_4.jpg'/><p>Soon, we saw a group of Japanese men in work wear approaching the boat, it was the coastguard.</p><ul><li>“Not this again…”</li></ul><p>We showed them our papers, everything they asked for. They were much more pleasant in person than on the radio, no unpleasantness what-so-ever. They were happy we were here and would point things out to us, places we should go see. Devine & I started to feel better then, we’d misunderstood their tone on the radio the night before. Japanese people are bound by rules, there is a set protocol that they need to adhere to and if a situation arises that doesn’t fit into that, they won’t know how to respond to it, or at least, they will be reluctant to act because the last thing they want is to go against the rules. They need to go through the proper channels, to make sure that their decision is okay with everyone. In the port of Shimizu, there are many people that are involved in allowing a boat into Port. This is what we had experienced last night, an overall reluctance to make a decision, a desire to stick to the rules.</p><p>The coastguard explained that customs officials would come and see us, only after their visit would we be allowed ashore. Devine & I looked at each other then, happy to hear that we weren’t really prisoners here, just victims of a very complex system. After customs came, we were free to roam!</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_27.jpg'/><p>They had allowed us to stay for 1 month on the public dock, to do repairs as needed. It wasn’t a bad place to be, very central and right near a mall. “S-pulse dream plaza” is a gigantic complex, complete with a Ferris wheel and Thomas the train rides. On the first few days we relied on that mall for internet, sitting in the “wifi area” while a Doraemon mascot screamed into a microphone, surrounded by a horde of kids. Early in the morning we’d sit outside, the mall only opened at 10am but the wifi was always on. We’d sit at a table and check our messages, as joggers did their morning runs around the basin.</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_22.jpg'/>");
add_part(&hello_fujisan, "Kazupon and Nobu san", "<p>From that time onward, we met a lot of locals. People would often walk near the boat and stop to say hello, this is how we met Kazupon and Nobu. These two local sailors were very welcoming, they came on the first day and invited us for lunch. We went to a delicious ‘all you can eat and drink place’, they assured us that there would be many vegan options for us. It was noon and we sat with them for 2 hours, eating and having an early nomihodai (all you can drink). They were excited to meet us and to hear stories of where we’d been. We too, were happy to finally get in touch with other Japanese sailors. They heard we were looking for a more permanent berth here in Shimizu and began calling friends on the spot to find one for us. We hadn’t asked for help but they insisted on it, saying they knew people who could, and would help. We couldn’t believe it. Later that week, they also invited us for a nabe night on Kazupon’s boat.</p><p>Kazupon was a dentist, he spoke good enough English and could help translate what Nobu was saying. Nobu was a retired electrician and professional sailor, we also learned later that he’s very good at making soba. The evening of the dinner on Kazupon’s boat, we agreed to a soba battle, for Devine to make homemade soba and to test it against Nobu san’s. We were all very drunk that night and it seemed like a good idea.</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_21.jpg'/>");
add_part(&hello_fujisan, "Soba battle", "<p>The day of the soba battle, we walked into Nobu's atelier with our mortar and pestle and our buckwheat berries, ready to dazzle him with our soba-making skills. Upon entering the room, we saw a soba-making station with a soba cutting knife laying over it, 'soba kiri' knives have a straight and long cutting edge to enable straight precise cut on the board to keep the width of the noodles consistent. The heavy weight of the knife assist in cutting of the noodles, usually with a slight forward cutting motion. This is a highly specialized blade, used only in soba-making, we realized then that our host wasn't a mere enthusiast, he was a true soba master.</p><p>The room was equipped with a large stone grinder and the biggest mixing bowl I’d ever seen. Around the room sat pieces of pottery, because Nobu was a man of many skills. He was an electrician, a sailor, a soba master and a potter. Needless to say we didn't win the soba battle, but we did learn a few tricks! We continued to do evenings with these two afterward, going to eat soba in restaurants or joining them for tempura parties on the marina docks.</p>");
add_part(&hello_fujisan, "Omotenashi", "<p>We also met the crew of our dock neighbor Dawn treader, namely an engineer and amazing sailor named Masa. We became fast friends and did many activities together in Shimizu. In fact, on the first day he offered to help us with laundry (since the coin laundry was far) and even invited us over to his place so we have a proper warm shower. We'd only just met, and already we were in his appartment using his shower and eating his food.</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_9.jpg'/><p>On another occasion, Masa invited us aboard Dawn Treader for a meal and an evening of magic and shamisen-playing — I kid you not. We met his partner Yukari and his friend Kamo.</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_18.jpg'/><p>Like many Japanese people we’d met, everyone had some special skill or hidden talent. Kamo played the shamisen beautifully, his performance was interspersed with random acts of magic. It was surreal. We realized that night that magic isn't simply about doing the trick, it also requires a lot of acting and energy. Masa and Yukari also revealed some of their own talents, performing a cover of Kurenai by X Japan on the ukulele.</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_14.jpg'/><p>Masa and Yukari treated us to many more fun outings, we attended a tea ceremony together. It was our first time seeing tea fields, rows upon rows of bushes lined up on a hill. The tea ceremony was simple, our host was dressed in a pink kimono and moved with incredible precision and grace.</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_19.jpg'/><p>Every movement was delicate and deliberate, there was no waste in it, no mistakes as if she’d done it over a thousand times. It was beautiful to watch. Our host served us a cup of warm matcha, along with a little red bean bun.</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_6.jpg'/><p>This wasn’t our first time in Japan, but it was our first time experiencing Omotenashi, or hospitality. Everyone made sure we were happy and comfortable and were eager to take us out to introduce us to the various flavours of Japanese culture. We accepted every offer, humbled by their kindness and friendship. Most times our friends insisted on paying for the meals we had at restaurants, this made us feel uncomfortable because we aren’t used to it. In Montreal everyone always pays for their own share, no one expects special favors — only on very, very special occasions. Both of us looked at each other everytime we were treated to an expensive meal, we wondered if we should insist on paying our fair share but after trying many times we simply decided to just smile and say thank you.</p><p>They were happy to treat us to these experiences, that’s just how it is here in Japan. We kept all of these kind gestures in mind, hoping that we’ll find a way to repay them somehow. Although, we know that Japanese people don't do these things expecting something back, it's just them being kind, them wanting to share what they love of their culture with you. For once, we decided to let them do these things for us, to just be in the moment and to not feel guilty.</p>");
add_part(&hello_fujisan, "A stay at the local fishing club", "<img src='../media/blog/shimizu_17.jpg'/><p>Between outings, we did repairs on Pino, ordering new slides for the main as well as a new toilet pump. We knew we wouldn't be able to stay here in Shimizu, even if we did enjoy being here. The public marina did not have berths for foreign boats, Kazupon and Nobu did try to get us in there but it was impossible. Our only option was <a href='https://www.noforeignland.com/home/map/place/5911018211377152/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1557534002631' target='_blank' class='external'>Fujisan Hagoromo Marina</a> in Orido. Like many other marinas in Japan, this marina only allows visitors to stay for 7 days per month. That was a problem for us. The weather out there was still too crazy, strong westerlies in the high 40's. We couldn't go out there even if we wanted to, heading south in such winds would be dangerous. At that point we thought of heading north instead, we did some research on marinas in the Yokohama and Tokyo area but these were too expensive. We quickly had to abandon that idea. A slip in that area would cost about 1300$ a month, that's more expensive than an appartment!</p><p>We knew we could stay on the concrete wall indefinitely, but the hard surface can be very damaging on a boat. We spent 2 weeks moored to that wall, our fender board ground thin by the barnacles and concrete. We had to leave the boat for a week to go to Tokyo but didn't want to leave it there, it's then that Nobu and Kazupon came through for us once again. They found us a spot at the local fishing club pontoon in Orido (34 59.243N 138 30.479E). The pontoon was old and rickety, but they assured us that all would be fine. We'd be able to leave the boat here, behind a locked gate during our absence. The best part? It was 100% free. We met the owner of the pontoon during a tempura party, he was more than happy to help us out. We ran into him many times during our stay on that dock, he would always come by and check up on us and to make sure everything was okay, especially during days when the wind was strong.</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_7.jpg'/><p>Leaving Pino is always worrisome, but we felt confident that this was a good place. We packed our bikes and left Shimizu to go to Tokyo. We wanted to spend time there with friends, to cycle through our favorite neighborhoods and to just relax for once, to not think of boat stuff at all.</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_10.jpg'/>");
add_part(&hello_fujisan, "A trip to Tokyo", "<p>We landed at Shinagawa station in Tokyo, put our bikes back together and cycled over to our friend Chase's place west of Shibuya. On the way, we passed through many neighborhoods, by Meguro, Daikanyama, Shibuya and over to Shimo-Takaido.</p><p>During our short stay in Tokyo we went back to some of the places we liked, and found some new treasures, like Chabuzen, a place that makes amazing vegan tonkotsu-style ramen. It was still very cold then, but the sakura trees were beginning to bloom. Many streets were dotted with pink petals, when the wind would blow some of these would go flying and would swirl all around, it was like being in a snowglobe.</p>");
add_part(&hello_fujisan, "Fujisan Hagoromo Marina", "<p>On our return from Tokyo we moved the boat into Fujisan Hagoromo Marina (34 59.316'N 138 30.564'E) for one week, to fill water and to get ready for our sail south to Minami Ise.</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_5.jpg'/><p><a href='https://www.noforeignland.com/home/map/place/5911018211377152/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1557534002631' target='_blank' class='external'>Hagoromo Marina</a> wasn't cheap, but at least we had power there and could run our electric heater in the mornings (was still very cold then) and could take hot showers — ah, been so long since we've had that! What luxury. We also used our stay in this marina as an opportunity to get rid of a few items aboard Pino. It's very hard to dispose of steel, large objets or objects consisting of mixed materials in Japan, the marina would take care of it all for us. It was during this time that we said goodbye to our dinghy Iggy. Iggy, as you know, was a real hazard. It couldn't float anymore, and it couldn't be fixed. We'll miss you Iggy, you've served us well.</p><p>Shimizu is now one of our favorite places in Japan. We enjoyed local specialities like flavored yokan, and very much enjoyed cycling around Miho through the forests and industrial area. Everywhere we went in Shimizu, we could see Mount Fuji, we never did grow tired of seeing it.</p><img src='../media/blog/shimizu_2.jpg'/><p>I think it's safe to say we've seen Fujisan in every manner possible, with clouds obscuring its top (like it had a hat) or skirting it's middle or bottom. Some days, the sky was so clear that I could see snow blowing off its peak.</p><p>Our arrival here was challenging, but we pushed on, pulled through and everything worked out. Devine & I are stronger together, that is something I've always known but that is even more apparent in tough situations. We now have eyes set on the next port on our list: Shima Yacht Harbor in Minami-Ise.</p><p>Saying goodbye to this place wasn't easy, we made a lot of friends here. I'd like to thank Masa, Yukari, Joe, Kamo, Nobu and Kazupon for making our stay in Shimizu memorable. Every Japanese sailor we met expressed a desire to go out there, to push off the dock — in a more permanent way — and to travel the oceans. It makes us happy to hear that, because it means we'll likely run into each other again.</p><p>We made a video of our time in Shimizu, check it out <a href='https://youtu.be/1uJuEADyYhY' target='_blank' class='external'>here</a>.</p>");

We passed through 9 countries, learned a lot about the world and, through it all, we've surpassed ourselves.</p><p>During that time, we often talked about what it would be like to arrive in Japan, about what would happen when we did. You have to remember that this was a big deal for us, a milestone in our lives and the culmination of 3 years of hard work. A fantasy made real is a hell of an achievement. A part of me couldn’t believe we’d made it — anytime now I’d wake up mid-ocean in transit in the South Pacific. Even when I’d have my feet planted on the ground, with a Japanese flag flying above my head, I knew I’d be anxious, waiting for something horrible to happen that would rob us of our victory.</p><p>'They’ll turn us away.', 'We’ve landed on the wrong island.' or 'We died in the pacific some months ago, and this is limbo.'</p><p>My eyes were set on the phantasmic island ahead. The sun fell out of the sky then, drawing down a star-studded curtain; the wind blew itself out, leaving the sea to settle into an unmoving and creepy oil slick. <b>Limbo.</b></p><p>A bright circle appeared on the horizon then. It isn’t the first or the last time that I mistake the moonrise for a ship, or the bright eye of some mythological beast.</p><p>At this point, it looked like we’d be entering Futami port at night, but at least we had the eye of Sauron to light the way.

I stood at the bow with a flashlight to illuminate any coming threats, and to warn others of our arrival because at this point our red and green lights weren’t working. Pino bucked hard on this trip, bow diving deep — we blame this for the breakage.</p><img src='../media/blog/ogasawara_10.jpg'/><p>The famous ferry, Ogasawara Maru, sat idly at the dock; the giant was sleeping, and we glided past it in silence, undetected. We pushed into the main fishing harbor, and as promised, all was clearly marked and visible in the night. Our docking space was unoccupied, but there was one problem... the wall we had to moor onto stood a lot higher than I could jump. I stared, wide-eyed, docking line in hand.</p><ul><li>“I don’t think I can make that.”</li><li>“Sure you can!”</li></ul><p>Devine said, with blind confidence.</p><ul><li>'You’ve seen my legs! Not much spring in these stumps! Um. Maybe if I stand on the pulpit…”</li></ul><p>Pino was approaching the dock slowly. I wondered if I could lasso the bollards. I’ve never done that and had no reason to believe it could work, but my mind raced on — what else could I do? My brain had no filter and conjured up many options that it knew would be impossible for this body of mine to perform; maybe I could put a foot on the lifelines, or swing off a halyard ‘a-la-tarzan’… Hell, maybe I could grow wings. Before I could decide, I heard Devine’s voice.</p><ul><li>“There’s a ladder!”</li></ul><p>My jumping skills would go untested.</p><img src='../media/blog/ogasawara_13.jpg'/><p>I secured Pino to the pier. During this precarious operation no one fell into the water or smashed a knee into a winch; even our toes suffered no damage —  a rarity aboard Pino. We’ve harmed our toes so often that they’ve threatened to atrophy.</p><p>A coastguard official was there to greet us.</p><ul><li>'You must stay on boat' he said to us, in broken English.</li></ul><p>We apologized, climbing back on Pino island. The official told us that they would clear us in tomorrow morning at 8:30 am — perfect. It was 9pm then, meaning we’d have time to relax and clean up our mess of a home.

We signed our names many times, and used our very best Japanese. We could understand most of what they said, but the official papers had many kanji; the thought of trying to translate it all made me hot in the head. At least we wouldn’t have to — many of the documents had English and the ones that didn’t were permits and I was confident I already knew what was written on them, which is enough, really. Customs came aboard next, asking us for the purpose of our visit.</p><ul><li>“Tabemono.” (food)</li></ul><p>He smiled at this.</p><p>For immigration, we had to step off Pino and visit their office in town. There, they had the same devices that are present in airports to check you in, the ones that take your photo and a scan of your index fingers.

When I first sampled karashi, or drank a cold yebisu, everything around me became less translucent, we had eaten the food of that world and like Chihiro we lost our human scent and became creatures of Chichijima. This place wasn’t some cruel hallucination — it was real!</p><p>We soon picked up our old habits, making food the way we used to in Tokyo and eating the same snacks. It felt like we’d returned to a state of normality, like we’d never left and that the whole sailboat thing was a dream. A quick look around dispelled that reverie, a Japanese way to describe this feeling is:</p><ul><li>夢擬き(yume modoki)</li></ul><p>It’s dream-like, but isn’t one.</p><ul><li>この生活は、夢擬きだね。</li></ul><img src='../media/blog/ogasawara_23.jpg'/><p>Chichijima isn’t a big place, and, unlike Tokyo, here the clock runs slow. There is no real rush to do anything. Stores close at regular hours, at 5pm konbinis and groceries are shut — it is a healthy way to live. There are only 2,500 people on this island, and most live near here in Omura, Okumura, Kiyose and Miyanohama. There are other towns further away, to the south east of the bay: Sakaiura, Ougiura, Komagari and Kominato.</p><img src='../media/blog/ogasawara_22.jpg'/><p>There are few stores and businesses. For locals it can get expensive to live here, the rent is high and not much is sold on the island. If you want clothes, furniture, electronics… these have to be imported from the mainland. There is no plane service here either — if people want to visit, or if they want to order goods from mainland Japan, it needs to come by ship (via Ogasawara Maru). The arrival of the ferry – which comes every 2 to 3 days – is a big deal for the town, not just because it means they’re getting their packages, but also because there is fresh foods and because it brings tourists to the island. On the day the ship arrives, boxes of fresh food are piled up high in front of the grocery stores, and employees are busy placing them on the shelves while the local people are filling their baskets. Two days after the stores are replenished, there are much fewer items available, the locals have raided the produce section and robbed it of all color.</p><img src='../media/blog/ogasawara_4.jpg'/>");
add_part(&goji_no_chaimu, "A touristic destination", "<p>The people of Chichijima rely heavily on tourism for money — the locals give dive tours, walking tours, operate restaurants or souvenir shops. All business depends on the visitors. Because we stayed here 3 weeks, we saw the ship coming and going many times and we noticed that some shops would close the day before, and after the ship leaves. The town and Ogasawara Maru share a schedule. If you don’t know it, it can be confusing, but at least it’s easy to know if the ship is here or not, because it is a behemoth and you can see it from away, and because the streets are full of people with windbreakers and bucket hats. When the ship leaves, the town makes a show of it — locals gather at the pier, waving, while others bang on taiko drums. When the ship sails out, dive and tour boats escort it to the entrance to the harbor, the people on it waving and yelling 'Itterasshai!' (see you later.) Devine & I were witness to these elaborate festivities once. We stood at the pier too as Ogasawara Maru left; waving, as if we too lived here. The people here value visitors, and giving them a memorable send off is important.</p>");

Many here have multiple jobs, odd jobs you can say. We met one person who was in charge of servicing and replenishing vending machines on the island. His other job was loading and unloading supplies from the ferry. Another person, our dear friend Bariton, repairs bicycles, volunteers at a garden and works at the town’s visitor center. We had a really amazing time with Bariton and his wife Chie. They graciously invited us into their home, where we shared stories, and had a tasting of their homemade miso. On another occasion, they invited us over for dinner and served vegetable tempura and homemade azuki with yakimochi. I think the reason they served us this, was because Bariton came on the boat once and saw an empty can of tsubuan from the store.</p><ul><li>“They put a lot of sugar in that.”</li></ul><img src='../media/blog/ogasawara_11.jpg'/><p>The dessert Chie made was amazing and its canned equivalent pales in comparison, the taste is subtle and the sugar content is much lower – homemade is best. On March 3rd is Hinamatsuri (girl's day), Bariton showed up that morning with a plate of sakura mochi, pink rice cakes that are wrapped in a pickled shiso leaf, and stuffed with sweet red beans. Another local came by too, with two little dolls (雛人形 'hina-ningyou'), to make sure we could take part in the festivities that day – so nice of them.</p><img src='../media/blog/ogasawara_15.jpg'/>");

When at anchor bringing our bikes ashore with the dinghy is always difficult, and even then, the roads in some of the places we'd been were less than ideal. But here, in Japan, the streets are clean and immaculate. Biking in Chichijima was especially great because there aren’t many cars here — the ferry can’t accommodate them and so the roads are not very busy. We went for many joyrides, exploring the island on two wheels. Ah, how we missed this! This place is very mountainous, so we had to walk our bikes often; but after 3 weeks of inactivity at sea our atrophied flesh much enjoyed the exercise. Every hill top offered a scenery worthy of being painted; dramatic cliffs, clear waters and colorful reefs.</p><img src='../media/blog/ogasawara_16.jpg'/><ul><li>“Are we really in Japan?”.</li></ul><p>We’d ask ourselves. Our previous experience of Japan was really different, we lived on the water but it didn’t have a crystalline quality, not like this. Here, walking by the pier and peering into the water, we’d see moorish idols pecking at the barnacles on the sea wall, sharing the buffet with other species of colorful fish I’ve yet to put a name to. One day we even spotted a 6-foot shark swimming in the shallows by the pier, crossing paths with the biggest sting ray we’d ever seen.</p><img src='../media/blog/ogasawara_21.jpg'/><p>Even amongst the trees, we’d see animals, like a family of wild goats (noyagi) munching on some greenery on the side of the road, or green anoles hiding under leaves of matching color.</p><img src='../media/blog/ogasawara_17.jpg'/>");

Everything we ate was sweet and fresh, very different from the bland and near-rotted produce available in Majuro.</p><p>I nearly lost it when I had a first taste of local cabbage. I know what you’re thinking. Cabbage? Yes, it is a humble ingredient, it’s something we rely on a lot on passage and that we’ve eaten often in the past, but it always served more as a filler in meals and was never the highight of the plate. The cabbage we bought that day was fresh, wet and crisp, as if we’d just picked it out of the garden of a skilled farmer, juices flowing from its stem still. We'd eat the leaves as a snack and savored every bite. Devine & I were smitten with this cruciferous wonder.</p><img src='../media/blog/ogasawara_24.jpg'/><p>We also had some tomatoes harvested in Hahajima, an island just south of Chichijima. These tomatoes, we were told, are very expensive. Bariton offered us a few of these lovely red jewels, a fruit so sweet that it defied all logic.</p><p>I forgot that vegetables, and fruit could taste this good. This is what Majuro has done to us, it made us forget that each has its own distinct flavor. Here in Chichijima, every ingredient was a precious and delicate note, each playing its part in the meal to create a synchronous whole.</p><p>Our first week here we made every Japanese dish we could think of, like homemade okonomiyaki, tororo soba, agedashi tofu, konnyaku sashimi, karashi renkon… we also bought some umeshu, and drank plenty of Yebisu beer.</p>");

You're better off taking a cab. It costs 1$ per person. Everyone here takes cabs.

Both of us were sure of what we'd heard, so we didn't bother to ask him to repeat it — that happens a lot, especially after long passages. We later learned it was called Tide Table. Ah, yes of course. Charlie must have been confused when Devine asked him if he thought the Thai food there was good.</p><p>At that point we knew where to find everything. We knew where to get beer, food, internet and where to check in. Charlie did mention that tomorrow was a holiday though, so that if we wanted to get these things we'd need to do it today.</p><img src='../media/blog/majuro.5.jpg'/><p>We said thanks to Charlie then, getting ready to step foot on land after 24 days on the ocean. We put our passports and clearance papers from Fiji in our dry bag, attached Turnip the outboard to Iggy's rump, and motored over to the dinghy dock ashore next to a bar called <b>Shoreline</b>. The small dock had fishing boats moored onto it, but at the back of it near the ramp were other dinghies. We left Iggy there so it could socialize.</p><p>As soon as we stepped ashore we noticed our legs felt weird, like the ground was pushing up against our feet. This a symptom of land-sickness, of having spent too much time at sea; neither of us felt ill, but it did take some time before we could walk like normal bipeds again.</p><p>We walked past the bar to try and find the main road — easy enough, Majuro has only one.

The street was occupied by cabs, with few personal vehicles around. We assumed that it was rush hour, it being near noon which coincides with the time people take off from work to eat at home. In many countries we've visited, a lot of businesses close around noon and open again around 1 or 2pm, this is true for Mexico, French Polynesia etc. I didn't make the connection in my brain then, that the government offices may also be closed, I was too busy trying to find a cab to pick us up. When tired my brain can't process to many ideas at once anyway.</p><p>One cab did stop, it had two spots available, we sat inside, saying a friendly 'hello!' and realizing then again that we had no idea how to say hello or anything else in Marshallese. We learned later that 'Hello' is <b>Yokwe</b>, pronounced <b>yi-yak-wey</b>.</p><ul><li>'To the immigration office!'</li></ul><p>I said. The cab driver did not respond to this right away, maybe they called the immigration office something else here? I'd heard that people here often make use of acronyms to refer to banks, stores of government offices, but unfortunately I wasn't familiar with them. Right now, I wished I'd taken the time to find out what that acronym was. The driver asked something in Marshallese to the other passenger, who replied in Marshallese. I understood nothing but the word 'finance'.</p><ul><li>'AH - yes! Finance! Yes! That's it' I said.</li></ul><p>Charlie had specified that the customs office had the word 'finance' on it.</p><p>While in the cab we sponged up our new neighborhood. It was very grey and rainy that day, but people were cooking food on grills outside anyway, the rain helped to subdue the cloud of black smoke rising from their metallic BBQs. One restaurant had stalks of bananas laid out on tables on the storefront, as well as some pinecone-like fruit that I'd never seen before. The shop also had breadfruit, but they were smalle and oblong-shaped, different than the ones I was used to. We took note of the stores, going past a few supermarkets like Island pride, Payless and EZ mart. We had no more veg aboard so we'd have to stop by later to get something fresh to eat.</p><p>At this point, we thought we could get back to the boat before 13h. Our plan was to make pancakes and coffee. My brain required caffeine and fidgeted uncomfortably in my skull.</p><p>When in a cab in Majuro, passengers don't call out where they want to go when getting in, in fact, we were startled by the absence of conversation; people usually just say when they want to get off, like on a bus. When you board a cab here, you have to make sure its going the right way because a car going south will not go north for you, it goes in that direction and that's it! This system only works in places like this, with a single road connecting all areas on the island. The cab stops for people as long as there is room, and will keep going until the end of the road, then turn around and go the other way.</p><p>The cab ride was short.

We hailed a cab and stopped at Tide Table, a restaurant annexed to a hotel called the 'RRE'. Walking around town that day, we noticed many building had that same acronym; it stands for 'Robert Reimers Enterprises' — they own a lot of buildings and stores here in Majuro. Tide Table is a bright blue building, at first glance it looks like some kind of aquarium. We climbed up to the second floor to the restaurant and took a seat inside; it was air-conditioned and because our clothes were wet our skin turned to ice.</p><p>Looking at the menu, we saw they had something on the menu called 'vegan sushi' and a 'vegan burrito'.</p><ul><li>'Whoa-' we thought, 'Here? Vegan food? In the Marshalls?'</li></ul><p>We liked this place already. We picked the lunch special, consisting of a rice and vegetable curry. I wondered what sort of vegetables they'd be putting into the curry knowing that Majuro didn't have a great variety. Before arriving, I'd read that most of the vegetables here are shipped frozen from either Hawaii or Guam. I've had the experience of buying previously frozen produce before and it's sad; the carrots rot within a day and the tomatoes taste like water. When buying vegetables, you've got to go when the ship's just arrived, or be willing to not buy certain items. This means i'll often choose potatoes, pumpkins or cabbage over peppers and fresh greens.</p><p>We ordered the curry anyway, it consisted mostly of black beans but had some tiny bits of pepper and cabbage; here in Majuro they use what they can get, and that the recipe varies from day to day. We really liked the food, even if the vegetable to bean ratio was off. With the meal — most important of all — we also ordered some bottom-less coffee, to attempt to re-animate our freezing corpses. We drank many cups, color returning to our flesh with every gulp. We are revenants, disciples of the church of coffea arabica.</p>");

When we arrived, the office was still closed, with a line of fidgety customers waiting at the door, we too added to this line, equally annoyed and fidgety. After 20 minutes, the doors opened and we hurried inside, presenting our papers to the first person we saw. We realized then that he spoke little English...</p><ul><li>'We want to check-in.

They gave us nothing.'</li></ul><p>He took note of everything, our boat name, time of arrival etc. I wondered then if the reason we didn't get a paper from Immigration was because we hadn't truly 'completed' the entrance process, or if it was because he'd forgotten to give us a paper bound for the customs official; or maybe, again, we were misunderstanding something. The official then said 'Ok.'</p><ul><li>'Ok? So it's done? Everything is ok?'</li><li>'Everything is ok.' he repeated.</li><li>'We don't get a paper? A receipt or anything?'</li><li>'No.'</li></ul><p>I hate leaving governement offices papers confirming the completion of an important exchange.

Iggy looked a little deflated, but I attributed that to the cold weather. I pumped air back into the tubes and we motored back to Pino. The weather was really rough that night, and the next morning was no better. It was raining non-stop.

The problems started in Fiji after we left Savusavu, someone in Makogai gave us a tow, as a favor, and the force of the pull caused the division between the two 2 air chambers inside to tear. We had another problem. The seams started to come apart, and that is HARD to fix. While in Lami (Fiji), our kind boat neighbors introduced us to a local who lent us a hard dinghy, we used while getting Iggy patched up (a dinghy we nicknamed Tippy, you can guess why). We did manage to fix Iggy, and this fix lasted us till the end of our stay in Fiji, but after 3 weeks of being folded on deck, Iggy developed another bad leak.</p><p>That morning, around 10 o'clock, Devine took our passports to shore with Iggy in the rain to meet the Immigration officer so we could get our passport stamped, then, maybe 30-40 minutes later Devine returned, completely soaked with a deflated Iggy.</p><ul><li>'Outboard stopped halfway, then Iggy began to lose air! Was adrift, and sinking, but came near a boat and shouted for help. The guy onboard gave me a tow to the dock, when we got there he said 'Your dinghy doesn't look sea-worthy'.

It was probably for the best, we'd go back to the office on monday ourselves instead.</p><p>This trip to shore revealed another serious air leak in Iggy. Back aboard, we took the outboard off in fear that it would sink with Iggy if it lost all of its air. I climbed into our sad inflatable to assess the damage. One of the seams on the front left side was open, there was nothing I could do from the water and so we heaved Iggy back on deck. I bought some PVC glue back in Suva (Fiji) that we could use to mend it, but by now both of us didn't trust Iggy anymore. Every time we glued one seam, another would come apart.</p><p>We weren't sure what to do. We were boat-bound with no means of getting to shore. When we left Fiji, we signed up to an email exchange group for those traveling to the Marshalls, and Karin from SY Seal sent us a message to welcome us. I sent her a message explaining our situation, and she promptly alerted her partner Cary. He came to see us the next day, and when Devine told him of our dinghy problems he offered to rent us a hard dinghy.</p><img src='../media/blog/majuro.2.jpg'/><p>This is the dinghy what we have been using since, a great fibreglass tender and better alternative to Tippy. We've been trying to repair Iggy in the meantime, doing our best to heal all its wounds but we know it won't last. At least we have some means of going to shore now, and this amazing hard dinghy just confirms our desire to have one for Pino in the future.</p>");
add_part(&the_promise_of_pancakes, "Pancakes for dinner", "<p>This concludes our entrance story into Majuro! We've since had our passport stamped. It took 2 days of going back and forth from boat to office. On the first visit, one of the officials was gone to the airport with 'the stamp' so the one in office asked us to come back some other time — yep, they've only got the one stamp. This is what life is like on these small islands. The officials that clear in foreigners in airports are the same ones that sit in office. We thought back on our situation with the immigration officer on our first day, and how he couldn't stamp us in, we now think the reason for that was because the 'stamp' wasn't there — we'll never for sure, but it's a good guess. Checking into the Marshalls in Majuro, we realized, is like playing a game of trying to catch them while they're in office, and making sure to refuse any offer to complete the process outside of regular hours.</p><img src='../media/blog/majuro.1.jpg'/><p>Clearing it wasn't great, but overall daily life here is good. The veggies are often rotten or scarce, but bananas are plentiful, and the restaurants are kind of great. There are lot of good Japanese and American products available, like Asahi beer and Lotus root snacks. The locals are amazing, understanding and kind; we've had a few laughs with the ladies that work at the ACE hardware after we caught them playing with some wind-up mouse toys. This ACE hardware is well furnished with electrical items that have our voltage (Pino is 110V); we bought a second fan for the boat there, something I wish we'd had for our last sweaty passage - lacking enough fans, we became 'puddle-people'. The internet here is great, we have a fast connection and can work from our floating office.</p><p>I forgot to say, but after getting back to Pino on the first day we made some savoury pancakes for dinner and it was the BEST.</p><p>To find out more about clearing into the Marshall Islands, read <a href='http://www.sailingmarshallislands.com/marshall-islands-info/' target='_blank'>this guide</a> by the <b>Mieco Beach Yacht Club</b>.

add_part(&doldrumming, "Goodbye Fiji", "<p>Here we go again, time for another passage. We left Fiji on <b>October 23rd 2018</b>, eager to spend some time on the water again. Our plan, was to stop by Tuvalu, maybe Kiribati, before arriving in Majuro in the Marshall islands where we'd be spending two months before moving off west to Micronesia. We left, knowing that this was wasn't going to be an easy ride...</p><p>Two areas of calms lie north of Fiji: the SPCZ (south pacific convergence zone) and the ITCZ (intertropical convergence zone). If you look at <a href='http://windy.com' target='_blank' class='external'>windy</a>, hovering around the countries of <b>Tuvalu</b> and <b>Kiribati</b> are two bands of blue - blue means there is no wind. The size and location of these bands varies from day to day, week to week.. they phase in and out of existence with the weather and influence of the trade winds.</p><p>Sailors fear these blue bands because the weather there is difficult, not only do you suffer calms, but also a continuous ballet of squalls and thunderstorms. We've been through the doldrums (the ITCZ) once already when we crossed from Mexico to the Marquesas.</p>");
add_part(&doldrumming, "Squalls", "<img src='../media/blog/tuvalu.1.jpg'/><p>Why do some sailors fear being becalmed at sea? Before we made the pacific jump, some admitted carrying enough fuel to carry them across an ocean and that in quiet times they wouldn't hesitate to use the 'iron wind'. More recently, another couple we met told us this:</p><ul><li>'You're just a sitting duck! Waiting for squalls to come at you!'</li></ul><p>Okay. Saying you're a sitting duck, implies that you're a thing with no protection against an attack or other source of danger. How is that true? Offshore sailboats are like mobile bunkers, besides, squalls last 20 minutes on average, just the time it takes for it to get past you, or for you to get past it. They hardly ever blow above 30 knots, you get wind out of it, and if you're reefed down properly (made your sail real small) and ready there's really nothing to fear! If really it is too much for you, you can always turn your back to it and run while it goes away, or heave to. These puffy beasts are hard to miss, their coming shouldn't be a surprise to you.</p><p>We, sailors, are not sitting ducks, we are FRIGATE BIRDS and like them, we are fearless and can soar on wind currents. We catch every bit of air we can get to stay in flight, soaring and biding our time.</p><img src='../media/blog/tuvalu.2.jpg'/><p>We were looking forward to crossing paths with these impressive cloud formations again because we'd read of sailors making use of them to propel themselves onward on a quiet ocean, and this is exactly what we'd planned on doing. When we saw one we'd present the curve of our sails and stick out our thumbs.</p><ul><li>'HEY! Over here! Come and pick us up!'</li></ul><p>Though if you're standing still, chances are the squall will pass you by...</p><ul><li>'Hey sorry!' the squall would say. 'I'm going this way. Sorry!'</li></ul><p>As it went away, as did any hope of forwardness.</p><p>Sometimes we'd turn the engine on, to try and get ourselves moving to get in their way. We didn't make a habit of this, Pino is not a big boat and we don't carry much fuel aboard.</p><ul><li>'Is this a good reason?'</li></ul><p>We'd ask ourselves.</p><ul><li>'Naw, better off bobbing on the water some more.'</li></ul><p>The only times we did turn it on, was when the wind had just passed, leaving big waves in its wake. Not having wind to fill your sails on bumpy seas is a most irritating experience. The boat pitches and rolls as it gets tossed around, the sails flap as the mast swings like a mad pendulum - it feels like the boat is getting ripped apart and I too, feel like my patience is being torn away bit by bit. During such moments I curse and swear, my anger rises to dangerous levels and before I go full-on Godzilla I somehow gather sufficient mental clarity and cool to turn on the engine - when the boat is moving, the motion isn't nearly as bad and it's usually enough to calm me down.</p><img src='../media/blog/tuvalu.4.jpg'/><ul><li>'Fucking waves, fucking weather. AH- the hell with this LIFE! Fuck boats! FUCK the ocean...!'</li></ul><p>Yup. Ocean times are not always pleasant. We do lose our cool from time to time... luckily, Devine & I are never angry or irritated at the same time, usually one is feeling good enough to work the other back into a good mood.</p><img src='../media/blog/tuvalu.13.jpg'/><p>While becalmed on the water, there is no breeze and when near and around the equator let me tell you,  it is HOT. When we became mostly sweat, we'd go on deck and scoop up buckets of sea water to empty over our heads. Ahhh - lovely. Then, we'd spend the next hour picking bits of salt off our skin. Clothes were optional on this passage, whatever we'd wear just ended up soaked in body water within seconds.</p><p>Being out there was more pleasant with a good breeze, which we would get every 3-4 days for 2 days. When downloading the weather, we'd always see a patch of blue coming into view ahead of us. \"More bobbing times ahead\", Devine would say.</p>");

My hand was on the end of that same tiller, just a short distance from it. I looked at the bird then...</p><ul><li>'Are you serious? Is this where you want to be?'</li></ul><p>The large feathered nuisance didn't react.</p><ul><li>'Really? Here?' I asked again.</li></ul><p>The bird then took off, perhaps annoyed by my incessant glaring and came to sit on the top of the radar post instead.</p><ul><li>'Good' I said then. 'That's a good place for you, you can stay there, but just so you know - the tiller is off-limits.'</li></ul><img src='../media/blog/tuvalu.3.jpg'/><p>At this point I had good relationship with this bird, I liked having it around, but the love story ended when it began to shit in a torrential fashion.</p><ul><li>'Okay.' I thought, 'It's not that big a bird, it'll stop shitting at some point.'</li></ul><p>It didn't.</p><p>Devine's shift started then, I went to bed, and when I woke up again I looked at the life raft, and our solar panel and was horrified at the sight of it all covered in drippy and stinky bird shit.</p><img src='../media/blog/tuvalu.10.jpg'/><ul><li>'It hasn't stopped shitting,' Devine said, looking desperate and equally horrified. 'I tried to shoo it off but it keeps coming back!'</li></ul><p>Our guest had overstayed its welcome. I spent my entire shift shooing it off of the radar post by brandishing a cushion at it. It probably thought my attempts at getting it to leave were feeble, using a soft weapon and all, I didn't want to hurt it but did my very best to keep it from getting too comfortable. It would take off when it got too annoyed, then come back to try and land again, I'd shoo it off some more with the cushion, then it circled back around to land again... we did this for 2 hours, and then eventually it decided that this perch wasn't worth the trouble and sought a new one on Pino's bow on the pulpit rail.</p><img src='../media/blog/tuvalu.5.jpg'/><ul><li>'FINE!' I shouted. 'Stay there!'</li></ul><p>At least we didn't eat, sleep or spend much time over there.</p><ul><li>'SHIT ALL YOU WANT! I DONT CARE!'</li></ul><p>I did care though because this bird had outsmarted us, it had found a new place to shit aboard Pino. We named this bird Clippy, because it had a feather missing in one wing. We saw Clippy again later, hovering above us with another of its kin. We feared we'd get twice the bird poo if we allowed Clippy and its friend aboard... but they decided Pino wasn't very inviting and sought a more friendly float.</p><p>Clippy wasn't our only visitor, when we left Fiji we left with 3 geckos. The first one we saw was in the mainsail as we hoisted it, we saw it scurry up the sail.</p><ul><li>'No don't go up there! THERES NOTHING FOR YOU THERE'</li></ul><p>We yelled, fearing that it would fall overboard - it didn't listen, but it also didn't fall overboard because we found it again in the anchor locker.</p><p>The other two, we saw hiding in the dodger, they would come out when the sun was low and the temperature dropped to look for food. Pino did have some insects aboard; a real gecko buffet! This was an ideal arrangement, they get to stay, while they help rid us of bugs - good deal! Every evening, we'd wait for gecko hour, and watch them walk around the deck. Geckos make good boat pets. They're non intrusive, non destructive, they eat undesirables and are cute as hell.</p>");
add_part(&doldrumming, "Change of plans", "<p>We had planned on stopping in Tuvalu in this trip, but we decided not to in the end. Why? Because the wind was good, and we just wanted to be out there. We had no desire to be back on land just yet. Crazy, we know.</p><ul><li>'So you want to be out there? Longer?'</li><li>'Um. Well. Yea! It's great! You can spend hours staring at the horizon daydreaming, planning future projects and brainstorming ideas for stories. There's no one around to disturb you, to tell you you have to do something else, no deadlines, no pressure either!'</li></ul><p>So we went past it, taking advantage of the 3 days of good wind that was forecasted (in truth, it ended up being 2 good days, because weather forecasts in that area are just not very reliable).</p><img src='../media/blog/tuvalu.15.jpg'/><p>The two good days though, did get us over to the first islands of Kiribati. Then, we were becalmed again, stuck between 3 islands with weak winds coming straight out of the north. We can't make good progress with winds coming out of where we want to go, so we'd tack west... than east, than west again. We'd sail between the same two points making no real progress at all. That day, i think we made 10nm northward. We got a text from Devine's dad.</p><ul><li>'Slow day huh?'</li></ul><p>We always feel a bit self-conscious about our progress, knowing people are watching and calculating the distance we make each day.</p><ul><li>'Only 40nm?! Yeesh. Are you on a boat or a piece of driftwood?'</li></ul><p>We did eventually get out of there, the wind fell back to the south east and we were able to make some good progress again.</p><p>We don't always read, or spend time thinking on long passages, we also nap a lot ( in the beginning anyway). Devine ran out of podcasts early on, and had the idea of ripping the audio from films or series. We'd listen to the audio from Lost in translation, Howl's moving castle and 30 Rock while driving at night. I'd laugh alone in the dark, listening to conversations between Liz Lemon and Jack Donaghy.</p><img src='../media/blog/tuvalu.12.jpg'/><p>In the evenings, we'd wait for the moon to rise, or set, then one night we noticed a cheshire cat-like grin in the sky.</p><ul><li>'WHOA the moon is side ways! It's lit from the bottom!' Devine gasped.</li></ul><p>We thought that maybe this was because we were at the equator, we still don't know what causes it, but it looked beautiful there... like a silver bowl, ready to collect the shooting stars that fall too near to it.</p><img src='../media/blog/tuvalu.9.jpg'/>");

Of all the time we've spent on the ocean, I've never caught sight of so much trash in the water. Every two minutes I'd spot a plastic bottle, some unidentified colored container, styrofoam... and once, a long orange tube undulating in the waves. We hadn't seen another human in over 20 days but here were clear signs of their proximity.  I looked to my left and saw yet another floating piece of garbage.</p><ul><li>'Oh no wait it's a bird. OH nope - it's a bird sitting ON a piece of garbage.'</li></ul><p>The bird was using a plastic bottle as a float, unlike me, the bird didn't give a shit about it being there.

We take care of our home, although sometimes things do get messy and items do break. One of the slides on our mainsail broke off, leaving a big portion of the sail detached from the mast. This causes air to pass between the luff and the mast and disturbs the shape of the sail while putting more pressure on other slides and slugs (we have 4 battens in our main). We could see then that another slide was about to break, half of it had snapped off already and so we reinforced it and hoped it would get us to Majuro - it did. In fact, it broke off entirely just as we were tacking back and forth to the anchorage inside the lagoon.</p><img src='../media/blog/tuvalu.11.jpg'/><p>This breakage, we believe, was due to us raising the main while not undoing the reef, a dumb, lazy and costly mistake that we've since corrected - I feel we're still learning how to sail.

Throughout most of our trip, we had moderate winds, now, just as we were arriving we had the strongest blows of the trip. Our arrival into new countries is always boisterous.</p><img src='../media/blog/tuvalu.7.jpg'/><p>Getting into Catalin pass was easy, it being well-marked and wide, the problem came after that; the main city lay on the easternmost point of the lagoon, we'd have to sail into the wind -  I did mention the wind was quite strong too didn't I? The town, as well as the anchorage, was 10 nautical miles away. This is nothing. We should have reached our destination under 2 hours but it took us about twice that time since we had to do long tacks to go forward. We were close-reaching, Pino handles that well enough most times but the problem today was the broken slugs in our main. We didn't like the shape of our mainsail, it was ballooning in weird ways, and that's when the slug for the upper batten broke off. We needed to keep the main up to go forward, the boat can't sail into the wind without a mainsail and our engine isn't strong enough to get us past these waves. Having to push something that is damaged past its limit is always worrisome, both of us fell quiet, eyes fixed on the top of the main.</p><p>Hold on Pino, we're almost there!</p><p>We tacked between the numerous large fishing and cargo ships anchored in the lagoon, hoping one of them wouldn't raise anchor and start to move; the last thing we needed was to start dodging moving targets.</p><img src='../media/blog/tuvalu.6.jpg'/><p>At this point, both of us were tired. Exhausted. Neither of us felt like doing endless tacks... the skies were grey, squall clouds in every direction, winds gusting to high 30's at times. Devine was feeling pretty down by then, we were making progress, but it felt unending. As i said before, when one of us is low, the other by default is almost always in a good mood.

When you come near the pier we'll send a boat to escort you to it.'</li><li>'Great, thanks!'</li></ul><p>We wouldn't be entering the anchorage in the blind after all. We would have eyes to guide us to a safe spot.</p><p>We motored on, nearing the pier, and spotted the escort boat. The driver came within shouting range, instructing us to follow, which we promptly did. They led us to a mooring, and assured us it was strong and that it could take our weight — not that Pino is heavy. We grabbed the line from the water, with a bit of difficulty, sometimes the mooring 'eye' for the buoys are submerged, and you need to figure out which bit to grab to get to it. We missed the mooring ball the first time, the whole endeavour was made worse by the up and down motion of the bow — there was a bit of swell coming into the anchorage from the north at the time. We rounded again to grab the mooring ball, i spied a thin loop at the top of the ball, and thrusted the boat hook in it. I hurriedly pulled the float out of the water, and my hands and the line found the mooring loop. This is not my favorite type of mooring ball, where you need to pull the ball up itself to find the rope hanging far underneath it, usually they'll put a separate float on the line to keep it buoyant. All moorings are different.</p><p>The northerly swell would stop soon, the forecast called for 20-25kts out of the SE tomorrow. On the chart, the area looked protected from swell, with a reef belt around it, but looking around now, aside from the tiny spit of land that is Leleuvia, there was only water. At low tide the reef became evident, as the water receded sand banks came into view, fencing us in from all directions but from the North. Phew. The reef would break most of the waves, but at high tide some swell would make it past it for sure — not ideal, but we would have some protection.</p><p>The next day the wind did freshen, and as expected, at high tide the waves spilled into the anchorage. It was bumpy, but not overly so.</p>");
add_part(&leleuvia, "The resort", "<img src='../media/blog/leleuvia.1.jpg'/><p>Iggy still needed mending, I'd fixed some of the seams but not all. We didn't trust Iggy enough at this point to use Turnip (the outboard), imagine Iggy losing air and Turnip flopping into the water — what a disaster that would be. Without an outboard, we had little chance of making it ashore in an inflatable with broken oars, especially with all of this current. Plus the weather that day was all-around shitty, squalls came in succession, Pino danced with them in passing, until they drifted out of range. The rain came down hard. We could see land, but couldn't get to it.</p><p>The waves in the night kept us awake. I couldn't sleep, wondering if that mooring was as strong as they claimed it to be. I can now say that yes, that mooring is good and we stayed put. We were getting restless though, and even walks up on deck couldn't stop the twitch in our legs. The wind had died down, so we decided to call the resort on VHF to ask if they could pick us up — they were happy to do it.</p><img src='../media/blog/leleuvia.5.jpg'/><p>The man dropped us off at the main pier, and we hopped onto land. It's weird to have the permission to come to a place like this, it feels exclusive, expensive and populated by tourists. It feels like we're cheating, as if we too should be paying something to be here. The mooring itself is free, although there is an unwritten rule about coming to shore at least once if you're on a mooring, to eat a meal at the restaurant, or have a drink. In this way, it pays itself.</p><p>The resort was composed of many separate facilities, with roofs of dried palm fronds kept up by thick logs. There were huts scattered all over the place, where the tourists stay. There was a dive shop, to rent diving or snorkeling gear, we even found showers that all can use (yes that means us too!). This resort was low-key, not overly expensive, which is kind of insane considering you need to take a boat to get here. It's far from everything, secluded — its own little country. And we're here, in it, for the price of a beer.</p><p>Resorts in Fiji didn't used to be this way, in the past they could restrict access to the land and the water around them. Giving the rise in numbers of resorts in the country, Fiji instated a law that annuled these restrictions and that returned access to all — Fijians and visitors alike. Some sailors in countries like Canada seek these same privileges, requesting access to waters that are no longer accessible to them. With the rising trend in real estate prices, more and more people will seek alternative lifestyles like becoming a liveaboard. Space on water needs to remain accessible to all.</p><p>In today's world, the 'right to anchor' is fantasy, widespread privatization of water and beach fronts is inevitable. If no one takes action, this will come to pass, groups in 'real-estate hell' cities like Vancouver are already taking a stand against this. Here's hoping they're successful, and that liveaboards will never suffer the woes of grid-living.</p><img src='../media/blog/leleuvia.4.jpg'/><p>Back on Leleuvia, Devine & I took a quick walk around the facilities of the resort. We walked to a sandspit to the south of the island that extended far, even farther at low tide. The sand was almost white, near perfect, and the same could be said of the water — certainly not in terms of color but of clarity.</p><img src='../media/blog/leleuvia.2.jpg'/>");
add_part(&leleuvia, "Circumnavigation by foot", "<p>We decided then to round this small island by foot. Most of the resort is concentated on the southern end, the rest is thick with trees, their arms reaching out and curling near the water. These arms carried families of terns, amongst them, some of the largest i'd ever seen, much bigger than the ones who came to sit on our pile mooring in Whangarei. The white, black-capped birds all took off as we came near, taking to the skies whilst cawking and screaming into the wind. Big slabs of coral bordered the water, flat and smooth, softened by centuries of wave caressing.</p><p>Blinded by the greenery and turquoise sea, we forgot to look at our feet, a striped snake drew near — hm, best look down every now and then. This island is very much alive, and writhing.</p><img src='../media/blog/leleuvia.3.jpg'/><p>After our circumnavigation of Leleuvia, we paid our unspoken dues to the resort by having a drink at the bar. Then, we asked the dive shop if they could take us back to Pino. One of the workers at the shop gladly volunteered to take us, — eager for a break, no doubt. We boarded the boat with him, and motored on slowly as we shared stories. He told us he is an olympic athlete, racing polynesian canoes. He is very proud of this sport, his face lights up as he speaks of it. It's great to see younger Fijians taking interest in traditional sport, it is used less for transportaion nowadays, but I'm happy it exists in some form. We drifted past Pino, listening to his story, his goals... but we all returned to reality then, he kicked the engine into gear and brought us home.</p><p>That night, we prepared Pino to leave, at sundown we raised the black moon.  We left the anchorage in the dark to make it to Suva at first light, with the waypoints recorded coming in, making an exit in little light was safe enough.</p><p>This was a short text, befitting this small island.

We love this city, but when it's time to go, it's time to go!</p><p>We left our mooring at 9am, and moved along over to <b>Cousteau's resort</b> to anchor (16 48.623S, 179 17.331E). The water was unclear, and the clouded sky made it difficult to see bommies beneath us. Devine dove in and checked out our anchor, which was set in sand, and we weren't near any huge coral that we could see, that is, unless the wind shifted - it was hard to see that far in cloudy water to be honest.</p><p>SV Privateer arrived shortly after us, having made the short passage by sail, we saw them manoeuver around, looking for a place to drop the hook.</p><ul><li>'What's the bottom like?' Lila shouted, baby Chance strapped to her back.</li><li>'Sand. A few bommies!' I shouted back.</li></ul><p>They hovered around some more, opening the headsail, furling it, in and out again, and moving the main in and out to make their way around the anchorage. It's always impressive to watch, not many will rely on wings alone to do this. They'll do as many tacks as necessary to get where they need to go - engines be damned!</p><p>We tried swimming at the beach that afternoon, but it was full of seaweed and unclear, we much preferred staying on the tiny slab of beach lining the shore to watch the hundreds of tiny hermit crabs moving about. They were different sizes, wearing a grand variety of shells - some spirally, others conical, stained with purples and whites, oranges and cream. We sat there in silence, listening to the sound of their shells rubbing against bits of broken coral. Such a pleasant sound, small scratching noises. Crkk, crkk... crkk.</p><ul><li>'Move along little ones - move along now! Tide's rising!'</li></ul><p>We left our hermit crab friends behind, and went back aboard Pino. Tomorrow morning we had to get up at 4am to sail to Makogai (pronounced ma-kon-guy), 49NM away.</p><p>The wind changed in the night, we could hear the chain rubbing against bit of coral, catching, before coming off again with a jerk, the sound traveling to us by the chain through the hull. We should have probably buoyed the chain, we thought then, but it was dark, and too late to think of doing this now. Hopefully, the chain wouldn't have this macramé thing going on with the bits of coral down there.</p>");
add_part(&where_is_the_turtle_farm, "Goodbye windlass", "<img src='../media/blog/makogai1.jpg'/><p>We awoke to a dark night, the alarm ringing at 4am, as planned, and realized then that our windlass didn't work anymore. I recently undid the connections to clean bits of rust off, I thought maybe I didn't put them back in right, when I went inside to check everything was good and tight, but something was wrong with the windlass motor: a screw was sticking out of one end.</p><ul><li>'That - is not good.'</li></ul><p>I reached for it, and was able to pull it out with ease, it was a long screw, attached to some thin metal rod, which had cracked off of something. I've little experience with this and could see the connections were good yes, but the motor was not- definitely not, bits of metal aren't supposed to crack off, that I was certain of. There is power, solenoid is good, but if we try and work the switches all we hear is this dull mechanical sound.</p><p>Luckily, we make a point of always anchoring under 40 feet, and we haul the anchor up by hand most times. Devine was able to get the anchor out, happy to see the chain wasn't stuck in coral after all. We motored off, since the wind was mostly dead - although I feel Privateer somehow would have found puffs of air to do it - and went out of the reef. There was a bit more wind outside the protective belt of shallows, and after raising the main and unfurling the jib we sailed on forward - slowly, but forward.</p><img src='../media/blog/makogai6.jpg'/>");

Rekka, rain magnet extraordinaire.</p><p>When the sun came up, the clouds too, dispersed and disappeared, both of us boiled under it, reddening in the fews places we'd forgotten to protect, like, behind the knees, or in the gap of skin where the shirt ends and pants begin - oh, and the tops of our fingers too.</p><img src='../media/blog/makogai12.jpg'/><p>We arrived to <b>Makogai</b> just around 2h30pm, and entered using the western passage.</p><p><b>Waypoints</b>:<br> Entrance to pass 17 26.824'S 178 54.555E<br>Mid pass 17 26.921S 178 54.927E<br>Anchor spot 17 26.480S 178 57.201E (~35feet).</p><p>We found a spot, our anchor set down there well enough, few small corals, but one especially large one lay right behind us everytime our boat would swing to the north. It was deep enough, and the prevailing winds kept us off it most times, there was no danger of our chain snagging in it either - all good! We wanted to anchor right of the pier, in shallower waters, at first, but there was a mooring there so we didn't try.</p><p>I was excited to be here, because I'd read they were raising giant clams, and there was a turtle breeding centre - a turtle farm!

add_part(&where_is_the_turtle_farm, "Sevusevu", "<p>Tired and sun-baked, we went to bed early. We knew we'd have to go ashore to do <a href='http://www.fijiembassy.be/index.php?page_in=yaqona' target='_blank' class='external'>sevusevu</a>, a practice done in all of the Fijian villages here, that consists of presenting a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fijian_traditions_and_ceremonies#Yaqona' target='_blank' class='external'>yaqona root</a> to the chief and of taking part in a kava drinking ceremony. Sevusevu is a way of welcoming you to the island, this is how the chief gives you permission to anchor here, and to walk on the island. For the ceremony, the chief pounds the dried kava root into a fine powder, straining and mixing it with cold water. The chief will recite some text in Fijian, then cups his hands, claps three times and begins to serve the grog. The grog is drunk from a bilo, a half-shell of coconut. Everyone in the room takes part in this.</p><img src='../media/blog/makogai11.jpg'/><p>We decided we'd go and do sevusevu, and the turtle farm visit, tomorrow morning instead, don't think we could have survived an evening of Kava.</p><p>The next day, I brought Iggy back to life, and Devine and I decided to row it to shore. Neither of us felt like putting the outboard on, we needed the exercise anyway, so we each grabbed a paddle and off we went! I was carrying our gift of yaqona root in a bag. The sailboat Scoots was anchored in deeper waters behind us, and came powering in with their dinghy, asking if we wanted a tow to shore. We figured why not - to hell with exercising, it's too damn hot anyway and we're crispy enough as is. We threw them a line so they could pull us along.</p><img src='../media/blog/makogai7.jpg'/><p>Just off the pier, there were 3 Fijian men working hard on a project. They were building additional concrete basins for their clam operation. Makogai has a giant clam farm, these mollusks are endangered - because that's what ALWAYS happens when humans decide animals are delicious. It's a shame really, considering they're centenarian creatures. It's also sad to think that if they're numbers go up, people will almost certainly start eating them again.</p><img src='../media/blog/makogai8.jpg'/><p>The locals here in Makogai grow them in basins, with water pumped up into the long concrete basins from Dalice Bay using pumps through long pipes. When big enough, they carry the clams back out to the water. These things can grow absurdedly large, up to 129cm across, and and can weigh up to 200kg! We stared at them, bathing in the basins, they stared back at us, grin creepily with their undulated lips.</p><img src='../media/blog/makogai8.jpg'/><p>Devine neared one of the locals, to ask THE question, the only one that matters...</p><ul><li>'Where's the turtle farm?'</li></ul><p>The local shook his head.</p><ul><li>'No more turtle farm.'</li></ul><p>Heartbreaking.</p><ul><li>'What? Aw! Nooo-'</li></ul><p>So that's that. No turtle farm today, not ever.</p>");

Bula!'</li><li>'You're the chief of the village?' we asked.</li><li>'No, no-' he said, shaking his head.</li><li>'-no chief here, not anymore, but I will speak for the island today. I will do your sevusevu. Follow me, we will do it over there.'</li></ul><p>The man was in work clothes, speckled with grey stains from working with cement, he had little teeth in his mouth, but smiled a whole lot. He brought us to a shaded area, under a set of covered roofs, with a black sheet of fabric laying on the ground. We arrived there, and he took a seat on the sheet.</p><img src='../media/blog/makogai13.jpg'/><ul><li>'Sit, sit - please!'</li><li>'We keep our shoes?'</li></ul><p>We asked, determined not to offend him, or anyone else here.</p><ul><li>'Shoes are ok, hats are ok, everything is ok! Please sit. You have camera?'</li><li>'Yea, we've got one.'</li></ul><p>We said yes, although this wasn't exactly picture-worthy, and had no plans to take any shots. Already then, we knew this wasn't going to be a proper sevusevu, this man, and the others around, were too busy today to do it.</p><p>We took a seat, and handed over the yaqona root. The man took it, and began to recite the traditional monologue, it ended with a chant, and three claps.</p><p>CLAP! CLAP! CLAP!</p><p>We understood nothing of course.

A bird, with a distinct sound, not anything ive heard before.</p><ul><li>'Been trying to spot it since I've been here.'</li></ul><p>We never did find out which bird made that sound, it eluded us, hiding in the foliage and moving whenever we came near. We did see many little lizards though, scurrying away as we walked past, taking shelter in the bush. We saw other abandoned buildings from the former leper colony, apparently they kept the chinese, indo-fijians and fijians lepers apart, and the women from the men too, which explained why there were so many buildings scattered about. Crazy to think that even in times of disease, the segregation of people is still a thing.</p><img src='../media/blog/makogai2.jpg'/><p>We didn't make it to the school, it was too hot out, and it was nearing lunchtime.

I tried to sit 'less' on it, leaning in the middle instead. We arrived then on Pino, my side near flat. We climbed onto the big boat, thanked Scoots, and then watched Iggy continuing to lose air while in the water. We were glad then that we didn't try to put the outboard on, that would have made Iggy lose air a lot quicker, not to mention, it puts the outboard at risk of taking on water. It's hard to sink an inflatable, even a deflated one, but still, having an outboard, and us in it probably wouldn't have helped much.</p><p>We pulled Iggy up on deck, to try and find the problem. It was clear to us then, there were no holes, but the seams had come apart in a few places. The glue had gone - from UV exposure we think - and the strain of being pulled by Scoots ripped them open - the final blow. Our dinghy is PVC, it was an inexpensive Plastimo dinghy that we got back in BC. It probably would have faired well enough if we'd stayed there, but no, we've been sailing in warm areas and this model just wasn't built for it. Our budgets at the time, didn't permit us to get a Hypalon dinghy, also, we just didn't think there was that much difference between the two materials.

We'd found a backup kit in a used yacht gear shop in Alameda, that came with a brush, patches and glue. I found the kit, but the glue was just a white tube, with no instructions what-so-ever - great. I've never done a repair like this before, and we don't have the internet to turn to for tutorials. I just went ahead, cleaned the area, and tried to glue the seams as best I could.</p><p>Then, I let it dry, and later tried sitting on various places to see if more air would escape. It seemed good, and we took it for a ride to shore to test it, no problem still, but I brought the patch-up kit and air pump just in case. We went for a short walk on the beach with the intention of bringing Iggy up to a diving spot, near giant clams some ways away. After our walk, we returned to the dinghy to find one side had collapsed again.</p><ul><li>'Damn it Iggy!'</li></ul><p>We put Iggy back in the water, and pumped air back into the tube, and sat in the center, with Devine sitting on the backboard at the stern. We did our best to avoid sitting on the tubes themselves to discourage the air from coming out again. We were rowing to Pino, with air gradually leaving the tubes. Devine was trying to row an inflatable with broken oar locks forward, while I was busy pumping more air into Iggy as we went along. Our dinghy has seen better days. For a moment I feared we'd have to swim back to the boat, Iggy in tow, but we made it back, and again, watched as our inflatable friend lay limp in the water, like an old, disused, party balloon.</p><p>The glue did work in some areas, but seeing as how there were no instructions on the packaging and that we didn't have internet I couldn't be sure if i'd really done it right. We pulled Iggy back up on deck, and rolled it up. It didn't look like we'd be doing any trips back to shore, shame, really did want to see those giant clams in the water. Also, Scoots was anchored much further down, in deeper waters, don't think Iggy the dinghy could make that trip.</p><p>Devine called them on the radio then.</p>");

Speed always makes me laugh, it's an uncontrollable sort of laughter, a mix of joy and fear. We saw Pino get small, real fast, and Scoots got big, real, real big, real, real fast. The boat is 50 feet, and damn gorgeous.</p><p>We had a lovely night, always great to meet fellow cruisers, everyone is just so different and lovely in their own way.</p><p>We were leaving the next day, Vandy radio'ed us early in the morning, just a quarter to 7.</p><ul><li>'I've packed up some Juniper berries for you! How do I get em to you?'</li><li>'OH! Wow thank you!

It landed on the dodger - good aim!</p><ul><li>'Catch you out there!'</li></ul><p>We shouted. Eric had a large shell in his hands, and blew hard into it. <b>FUUUUUMP!</b> A way of bidding us farewell. We'd noticed then that another yacht we'd met yesterday had drifted way back into the anchorage. The wind had picked up in the night and they'd dragged anchor, luckily, the water in the entrance was shallower and their anchor got caught in it.</p><p>We'd heard the sound of a horn, late in the night, but didn't know what it was and our tired minds did not think of looking to find out its source, or why it had been sounded in the first place.</p><p>We motored past the boat on our exit.</p><ul><li>'Morning! You guys okay?'</li><li>'Yes yes!' they said.</li></ul><p>It was hard to hear them, because of the wind.</p><ul><li>'Did you *something something* horn last night?'</li></ul><p>I thought they'd asked if we had HEARD the horn, and so I answered:</p><ul><li>'Yes!'.</li></ul><img src='../media/blog/makogai5.jpg'/><p>I said this, thinking she'd explain, because I too wanted to know what that was about!</p><ul><li>'Thank you so much!' they said, smiling.</li></ul><p>Woops, I realized my mistake then. They probably asked me, if we had sounded the horn last night, and I'd taken credit for it. The story was that Scoots, kept anchor watch at night, when the wind picked up, and they saw the boat was further away in the anchorage. Scoots blew the horn in the night, so they would hear, and maybe find out that they had moved some ways away from their original location. When you're far away, and no radio contact, this is a good way to wake people up.</p><p>Very happy to say that we didn't move at all in the night, we have our new heavier anchor to thank for that.</p><p>We hoisted the sails, and Pino moved out of the reef, heading southward, towards our destination: <b>Leleuvia</b>, a small island south of <b>Ovalau</b>.</p>");

We needed new batteries, a new mainsail, a fresh coat of bottom-paint, galley plumbing, new intermediates shrouds, new backstay, new top hatch, new windows, new control cables etc.</p><ul><li>'If we can't finish all of these projects, then we can't leave.'</li></ul><p>That was the deal. There was too much ocean between us and Japan. Our vessel needed to be made safe to endure it, and to ensure our safe passage.</p><p>When we landed in the country, we had grand ideas, 'grand illusions' I should say, about what we thought we could get done by ourselves. We wanted to learn, but we also wanted to save money. By now, we knew how much it cost to offload the work to others, and it's not something we knew we could do.</p><p>Below, is a detailed account of all the repairs we did on Pino during the 9 months we spent in New Zealand. This is a technical post, interspersed with bits of story, present and past. For those who don't know the terms, but that are interested, I'll do my best to explain them all throughout the text.</p><p>Here I go!</p>");
add_part(&pino__projects_and_pain, "Batteries", "<img src='../media/blog/nz2.haulout.4.jpg'/><p>About a month after we arrived in NZ, our batteries went flat in the night. Completely dead. We heard the inverter beeping, complaining it didn't have enough power to function.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.batteries.1.jpg'/><p>That woke us up.</p><p>We were expecting this. The batteries were not performing so well these days, or even in the last year. There were times when we had to start the <a href='liveaboard.html' target='_self' class='local'>portable generator</a> to get the engine going, especially early in the mornings when the sun was too low.</p><p>After our batteries died in Whangarei, we went to <b>Snow brothers</b>, a car battery store, to ask if they had four 6-volt batteries in stock - they did. The batteries were a bright red colour, with a big American flag on the front. Ah, yes, the golf-cart batteries of patriots.</p><p>We opted for the same battery setup as before, four lead-acid batteries, two on each side.</p><p>We bought the batteries, and Snow Brothers offered to deliver them at the marina. They also offered to pick up our old ones to dispose of - great! These things are a pain to carry. Back on Pino, we unhooked all the cables, and lifted the batteries from their restraining boxes. The batteries were bloated, the sides had a curve to them. Yep. These batteries were done, sulphated, and beyond help.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.batteries.2.jpg'/><p>We put one in an old milk crate we had, and lowered it into the dinghy, we did the same for the other set, carrying two at a time because Iggy a a soft floor and cannot carry too much weight at once.</p><p>Snow Brothers carried our bloated batteries away, and we returned the new ones to the boat, again, in teams of two. We hooked them up, and Pino was sentient again.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.batteries.3.jpg'/><p><b>Takeaway</b>: Don't forget to water your wet batteries, we didn't do this so often in the beginning (knowing nothing about boats or batteries). They'll last a lot longer than ours that way! It's silly, but we didn't know it's something we had to do. We didn't know anything about the innerworkings of cars or any other kind of powered vehicle.</p><p><b>Batteries</b> 810$<br><b>Total</b> 810$</p>");
add_part(&pino__projects_and_pain, "Solar panels", "<img src='../media/blog/nz2.solar.1.jpg'/><p>I noticed one morning an ad on Whangarei marina's bulletin board, concerning a set of two 90W panels for sale. At 150$, we knew we wouldn't get a better deal than this, so we contacted the owners, and went to get them.</p><p>The owners were upgrading to bigger panels, because boats nowadays require more power, to keep up with power-hungry electronics. How else can you power two fridges, a microwave and an ice crusher? The unfortunate solution is always MORE power. We get the hand-me-downs, the left-overs — it's how most people our age get boats.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.solar.2.jpg'/><p>We removed the 60W panel we had on the forward deck of the boat, it was too exposed to spray, a bad idea overall. We didn't install this panel again, because we discovered creeping corrosion in the wiring. It is possible that this panel wasn't marine-grade. The wires were sealed up, but still, water found its way in. We moved the 100W panel from the bimini top (the open front canvas top over the cockpit, supported by a metal frame) to the dodger (the spray hood above the cabin), and the two 90's on the bimini rack. Now, instead of 160W, we had 280W.</p><p><b>Takeaway</b>: Don't install panels too low on your boat, or somewhere waves can wash over them. Also, if you're going to install panels over the cockpit, have a proper arch made (if you don't already have one). We recently removed the two panels from the bimini rack, because it wasn't made for that, and we feared it would collapse under strain (heaving to in winds 40kts+). As of now, we only have the 100W on the dodger, and with a 90W set up on the aft-most seat under the tiller. The other 90W is inside when we're underway, and we put it out on deck when we're at anchor. The panels we bought are too big and too heavy for our boat, it was a good deal and it helped power Pino for 1 year, but for offshore passages it's just not ideal. Having an arch built is possible, but Pino is a light boat, adding more windage and weight will reduce performance, so, as of now, we're undecided.</p><p><b>Solar panels</b> 150$ <br><b>Total</b> 960$</p>");
add_part(&pino__projects_and_pain, "Removing the windows", "<img src='../media/blog/nz2.windows.1.jpg'/><p>One of the scarier projects on our list was to replace our windows. Pino has 3, on each side, they have a lot of surface and a bit of a bend to them. We had to do this right, to avoid redos or potential leaks. People warned/lectured us about this, 'It has to be done right!' Whenever we mentioned to someone we were re-doing our windows, people always had something to say, suddenly, everyone was an expert. Can't say how many times we had people tell us the best way to do things, this, without us ever asking it of them. All boats are different, not everything that has worked for them will for work for us. Even before we'd started, they prophesized our failure.</p><p>When came time to start this dreaded project, our first decision was to cut the aft-most window of the boat in two, the longest of the three, with part of it overlapping a fibreglass backing. Our old windows both cracked in that place. The boat twists as you sail, and acrylic contracts and expands with the heat and the cold, the sealant helps to cushion the motion.</p><p>Another big change we made, was to make the windows thicker. The originals were 6mm thick, and we increased it to 8mm. Our thinking was that added thickness too, would add some strength. I cannot yet vouch for the quality of that decision, as we have not traveled with them long enough to ensure it was the best idea. More updates on that to come.</p><p>We intended to buy sheets of material, to cut to size ourselves, but lacking space, tools and time, we decided to have the windows cut by <b>Seamac</b>, a shop in Whangarei specializing in windows. We visited the shop, got a quote, thought it to be reasonable, and so we went ahead with it. Unfortunately, the price did go up, considerably; more on that ahead...</p><p>We had no real technique for removing the windows, it's a shitty job that involves cutting the silicone sealant with a long blade, then, to prise the window from the seal with a lever (we had a wood knife. Not ideal), while cutting through the silicone with the blade as we went along. I read somewhere, that using a wallpaper scraper as a lever works well.</p><p>We lacked patience, which resulted in the window cracking in many more places. Our windows had a LOT of sealant, making it extra difficult to remove. Our windows don't have an outer frame, or screws for support, the only thing holding them in place is the black gooey stuff, the silicone adhesive. The part of the window overlapping the fibreglass backing gave us the most trouble. It was a 25x30cm area, thick with black stuff, jamming a knife through that was hard, impossible; we didn't have a blade that long or that strong to pierce it all the way through.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.windows.2.jpg'/><p>Removing these windows took many hours, laid over many days. The weather was rarely on our side, and so we decided to only remove the starboard side windows, and to use these as a template for both sides. This, turned out to be a mistake. The windows may look the same, but they aren't. They are very much asymmetrical. We didn't want to remove both sides at once, because it was raining a whole lot, and because we live and work in the boat and wanted to be comfortable.</p>");
add_part(&pino__projects_and_pain, "Preparation to install windows", "<p>I had tarps taped up on the starboard side, to cover up the windows at night against both rain and insects. If we'd removed both sides at once, I think we would have had a hard time living in Pino, especially since the work spanned over 3 weeks, this, including the time it would take for Seamac to cut the windows - they were very, very, busy at the time.</p><p>Once we had the windows off, we taped up the broken pieces together, and brought them over to Seamac, already then, well aware that they wouldn't be able to use them as templates. They would have to re-draw new ones, adding to the production time and cost (and so begins the long line of added costs). We only have ourselves to blame for this, because we had little help and few resources, and because we didn't know better.</p><p>The windows had need of a black primer, applied to a band on the inside of the window, on the part that would be in contact with the sealant and the fibreglass. While protecting the silicone from the sun, the black primer makes for a nicer, cleaner finish. Seamac applied the primer for us, they also put a protective film over the surface of the acrylic in two layers, leaving one to protect the inside part of the window, to be removed last. The quote was 350$ initially, but in the end, it cost us about 1100$ for the material, cutting, black primer, 13 tubes of silicone sealant and templating.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.windows.4.jpg'/><p>In hindsight, we should have sought help for removing the windows. We wouldn't have required templates if we'd done it right, which would have reduced the costs significantly. We did have help for the second half of the project though, having a mentor helped us do it right.</p><p>While waiting for the acrylic to be ready, we scraped all of that black stuff off. It took ages to do it. We had razor-blade scrapers to take off the rough bits, then we sanded the edges by hand, and then borrowed a sander to smooth it off (while helping to create a rough surface for the sealant to adhere to). Once the surface was devoid of black stuff, many long hours and days later, we cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol. While giving the surface a good clean, isopropyl alcohol doesn't leave it wet, it evaporates quickly, which is essential for bonding.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.windows.3.jpg'/><p>");
add_part(&pino__projects_and_pain, "The right sealant", "Eventually, we received our windows, and the package of many, many, tubes of <b>Fixsil FS200 silicone</b> (black gooey stuff). Our windows are not fixed mechanically, all that is holding them in is the black stuff. Some other Yamahas add bolts, but we found that more often than not, their owners reported them leaking, because as I've said, the material twists, expands and contracts. Fixsil FS200 is a high-strength 100% silicone adhesive, it's UV and salt water resistant.</p><p>An essential part of adding windows without mechanical fixings, is to add spacers, at a size that matches your window's width, height and thickness. The sealant's technical spec sheet should be able to tell you the thickness required, all are different. The spacers we had were little rubbery bits, that we cut to size, and that we glued to the fibreglass with <b>contact glue</b>. We had planned to fibreglass over them, but decided against it in the end.</p><p>We placed the spacers all around the area where the window would go, so that when we'd apply the sealant, and the window on top, that it would end up resting on the spacers and not push out too much glue while keeping it levelled at an even thickness all around. We also added spacers under the window to hold it up, to know exactly where it would go when came time to put it on.</p><p>Devine & I then put the windows in place, without sealant, laying them against the spacers to see if they would hold, and to mark off the areas where we'd have to put tape. The tape ensures the sealant is applied cleanly. I made sure to add enough distance at the top of the window, to ensure the seal would have a good angle. If there is no angle in the seal at the top edge of the window, moisture will accumulate. I also added tape around the windows, from inside the boat as well as a 'bib' under each window, to catch any drippings, if any. All this preparation, ensures that we'll be able to focus on applying the windows without worrying, without distraction. When you're doing something like this you want to focus on doing the work, not on catching drippings.</p>");
add_part(&pino__projects_and_pain, "Mechanical fixings and defects", "<p>We prepared some bits of wood, that we'd lay outside of the windows to add pressure, a way of making sure that the acrylic stayed in place. We had bits of bamboo, and our dinghy oars, with one end covered with foam - as to not damage the window - and the other end would be wedged into the toe rail. The sealant we bought, did say that we would have no need of any mechanical fixings to add pressure, that the sealant would be enough, but we preferred to do it all to ensure a good adhesion.</p><p>A hard thing about this project, was to wait for the proper weather window to start. The weather needs to be very, very dry. If there's too much moisture in the air, it can reduce the adhesive properties of the sealant. This is difficult, because it rains a lot in Whangarei. The town lies in a depression, between mountains, making it very rain-prone.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.windows.5.jpg'/><p>Once we did find a day to start, came another problem, the acrylic windows had a thin plastic protective film over them. We removed the outer film, and with it, came the primer. The primer was sticking to the film. We called Seamac to tell them about this, they said it shouldn't do that, but it did. So we made the best of it. Before putting the windows on, we'd dip our finger in the black stuff and rub it over the parts of the window that had lost bits of primer. From an aesthetic point of view, it would help, although we could see a slight difference in blackness. It's really not a big deal, but when you've planned out every step to perfection, it sucks to have this happen. While no other will notice, this defect is very visible to us.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.windows.6.jpg'/><p>No matter. We pushed on.</p>"); 
add_part(&pino__projects_and_pain, "Installing the first window", "Jim, our window mentor from the sailboat <b>Bright Moments</b>, came to help us apply the first window, he'd done this sort of work before and came at our request. His advice turned out to be extremely valuable, we couldn't have done it without him.</p><p>We cleaned the surface one last time with isopropyl alcohol, then, came time to open the first tube of sealant. We cut a deep 'V' shape at the end of the plastic nozzle with a blade, matching the thickness of the spacers (this is very, very important), and began to apply it to the fibreglass. Then, we ran over the gooey stuff with a flat tool to spread it well. In hindsight, we should have used a spread tool with little wide teeth, to create gaps, this too would help both sides to stick to each other. I went inside, while Jim and Devine were outside, and put the window in. I had tools at the ready, to 'tool' the sealant around the window, to produce a clean and even finish. I had lots of paper towels around, and trash bags to dispose of them. This was a dirty job, and with the sealant drying quickly, we couldn't waste time cleaning tools or worrying about it staining things in the boat.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.windows.7.jpg'/><p>Devine and Jim pushed onto the window from outside, pushing it flat against the spacers, with the bottom-edge laying over the bottom spacers. It was thusly, perfectly positioned, with the black stuff oozing out of all sides. Then, they began to tool the area around the windows, removing the excess, and adding more sealant if any was missing. We kept a bowl with a mix of water and dishwashing liquid nearby, we used it to soak our finger to clean up the sealant, dipping it in the bowl of soapy water will stop the gooey black stuff from sticking. Inside, I too, was busy removing the excess sealant, and adding more as needed. Once we'd removed the excess sealant, and that all was clean and to our liking, we each removed the protective plastic from the acrylic. We couldn't wait too long to do this, because if the sealant dries, it'll start coming out in 'strings' and may damage all of our beautiful work.</p><p>We removed the film, and then the protective tape, and voila! Window number one was in! We applied mechanical fastenings, pushing the bits of bamboo onto the windows, and then turned to the second, and third window, repeating the same thing. These, we did alone, it's dirty work and Jim helped us enough! THANK YOU JIM :)!</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.windows.8.jpg'/>");
add_part(&pino__projects_and_pain, "Assymetry", "<p>We set plastic tarps back over all windows, to protect them from the weather and the sun, as directed by the sealant's information sheet. We left them covered for a few days. Pino had windows! We, and the elements, were separate again.</p><p>We repeated all of it for the port side windows, although, as I mentioned earlier, we made the mistake of using the same templates for both sides of the boat. Don't do that. The windows fit, that wasn't the problem, but the primer around the windows was not perfectly aligned to the fibreglass, which means the plastic film was tough to remove inside at times, caught between the fibreglass wall and the window, and that one of the windows has some primer visible from inside — not a big deal though, we can scratch that off easily. Not the worse mistake we've made. Still, not all windows are the same, something to remember for the future.</p><p>We also realized then, that our front starboard side window, wasn't a real window at all! It's laid onto a full fibreglass backing. How did we miss this? We laughed. They put a window there to make the design of the boat symmetrical, because the port side opened onto the head. If there had been a window on the starboard side, it would have opened onto a dark closet.</p><p><b>Take away</b>: In doubt when doing a difficult project, seek help from others, don't hesitate to do that, it'll save you time and trouble down the line. Pick your weather, be patient and don't rush it, if you do it right you'll only need to do it once (until comes time to do it again, but that should be many more years later).</p><p>People will tell you how you should do things, that's okay, but when everyone starts to do it it can be a bit dizzying, and you might make a wrong decision. If you trust you've done your research, stick with it, you'll do well, just don't skip any steps. Always wait for weather, don't try and finish things too quickly. Ask for help, we asked Jim because we knew he had just redone his windows recently, and because the techniques he used were the same as ours.</p><p>Ask questions when and if you can, a lot, about everything, especially in your newbies like us.

add_part(&pino__projects_and_pain, "Haul out", "<img src='../media/blog/nz2.haulout.0.jpg'/><p>I feared this moment. Of seeing what the hull was like after spending a few months in the Town Basin. Our bottom paint, we knew, was old, and staying in these hot brackish waters likely made it worse. We'd heard New Zealand waters were... healthy, quick on the growth front.</p><p>The day that we scheduled our haul out, was also the day when tropical storm Gita passed near New Zealand. Whangarei was safe, with the harbour tucked deep in a river, but we got a lot of the wind and rain. We motored off the pile mooring with ease, our prop wasn't fouled - good. I had nightmares about us not being able to move, the prop heavy with ocean-stuffs, with us losing control and drifting onto other boats, or worse, onto the canopy bridge with the concrete grinding into our mast. Prior to leaving, people told us stories of boats not being able to move because of all the shit caked under their boats. Their stories only fed this irrational fear of mine.</p><p>Pino skidded on the water well enough, and we made it to <b>Dockland5</b>. We did have some difficulty steering the boat onto the slings, given the weather, with the wind screaming into our rigging.</p><p>Upon seeing Pino out of the water, we gasped. Pino's belly was full of brown clammy bits, forming a thick shell, a disgusting crust of sea things.</p><p>Pino, better known now as 'The Flying Dutchman' — at least, on its underside. Any moment now, a human-like shape, a clam for a head, would detach itself from the hull and go on a walkabout while chanting:</p><p>We used an ablative paint, which means that the paint comes off over time. Usually, 3 coats of paint is enough.</p><p>After a few layers of primer, once it had dried off, came time to apply the anti-foul paint. We bought one big can of black <b>Carboline</b> antifoul; one can was enough to do 3 coats.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.haulout.3.jpg'/><p>Drying time can be long between coats, we took this time to do other jobs on the boat, like, replacing the plumbing for the galley (our boat kitchen) sink.");
add_part(&pino__projects_and_pain, "Plumbing", "In Canada, and all the way down to Mexico, we were using our salt water pump in the galley, and unfortunately, in warmer waters, it caused the inside of the sink drains to corrode. We had to replace those, but removing the drains meant disconnecting the pipes below, which in turn revealed some pretty nasty stuff.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.drain.1.jpg'/><p>The pipes were clogged, and old - overall disgusting. So. What started as a drain-replacing project, turned into a galley sink overhaul. We spent much time at <b>Mitre10</b>, laying pipes out on the floor, to find the right-sized elbows and tubes.</p><ul><li>'Okay. Drain head, goes to lock joint, which goes to tube, upsized to a another, bigger joint, to a another tube, to an elbow, to another tube...'</li></ul><p>We had a nice puzzle thing going on, an exploded view of our future sink setup. Employees in the store stood around us, helping us find the correct parts.</p><p>Passing pliable pipes through floors and narrow gaps is always tough. We taped the end of the pipe to the new one and pulled, hoping it wouldn't come apart in the process. Do it slow, so slow, otherwise you're FUCKED. Being gentle and patient is a common tactic when it comes to boat projects.</p><p>We also replaced the galley faucet. The boat had a pressure faucet before, but we didn't use it, because we prefer to use the foot pump - more economical you see. Every press is a 1/4 cup of water. We removed the pressure faucet, as well as the old foot pump faucet that came through inside the sink (which had also begun to leak). We installed our new faucet head between the two sinks, in the place of the old one, and plugged up the hole the foot pump faucet left behind. We opted for a simple model, because the more extravagant, heavy duty one with a pumping handle didn't fit in that space vertically - shame.</p><p>When that project was over, came time for another bottom coat. We interspersed waiting times with other projects, which made our days quite long. We always went to bed exhausted. Our boat was still windowless then, and messy from other ongoing fixes, it was tough to really do anything other than boat stuff. Our laptops were put away, orphaned, and confused.</p><p>Pino looked amazing with a fresh bottom and with a clean waterline, we cleaned up some oxidation stains with some <b>Grunt</b>- that stuff works wonders.</p>");
add_part(&pino__projects_and_pain, "Prop problems", "<p>We also cleaned the prop thoroughly, it had lost some of its shine, not just this, we discovered then that we had to grease the thing.

That seal, was beyond done, dried up and crusty by sun and salt. The rubber seal was not protected from the sunlight at all, it's a poor design if you're sailing in warm and sunny places.</p><p>During our transit to NZ, sea water came in past the crusty seal while I was asleep, a wave splashed over the bow, and slipped inside, sending a torrent of wetness where I was sleeping. The sleeping bag, and the cushions were wet. I remember grabbing a cushion then, and shoving it in the 27x27cm hole and keeping it wedged up there with layers, upon layers of duct tape. This wasn't the best solution. In my defence, I was half asleep, kind of dazed, and grabbed whatever I could find in the dark. It was funny to find the next day though, a cushion thick with salt water and compressed into a tiny space bound by infinite amounts of tape.</p><p>We thought this top hatch setup wasn't ideal, also, the big piece of acrylic had many cracks in it and was near dead.

We then placed the wooden frame over the hole, and screwed it into place. Then, we epoxied the shit out of that frame, making it one with the existing body of the boat. We epoxied, waited, sanded, epoxied again, waited, sanded... till it was nice and smooth.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.hatch.3.jpg'/><p>We painted the entire frame, to a color approximating that of our boat, except that it had a subtle yellow tint. We also epoxied and painted the area inside the cabin, making for a smooth transition.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.hatch.4.jpg'/><p>Then, we marked up holes for our new hatch onto our shiny new base, where the window was going to go, and drilled holes into it. We scuffed the surface of the base lightly, then added some spacers all around, solidified with contact glue. The spacers will ensure an even thickness of sealant all around, between the hatch and the base. Once dry, we applied a sealant, grey stuff, that ensures aluminum to fibreglass adhesion. Then, we pressed the window onto it, and put the screws in. We added more sealant around the edges, tooling it in for a clean finish, soapy water at hand, and did the same inside.</p><p>Hatch project was done.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.hatch.5.jpg'/><p><b>Takeaway</b>: Maybe, if you can, install the window at a slant, so the water won't collect on it.

add_part(&pino__projects_and_pain, "Removing the wheel post", "<p>A tiller, for those who don't know, is a steering alternative to a wheel. Instead of a circular wheel, you have a bar, usually made of wood, that is attached to a rudder post, which in turn, is attached to the rudder (a sort of long and thin rectangular flap). If you move the tiller to the left, the rudder moves to the right, and so with this you direct the water one way and then another. Driving with a tiller, gives you a more direct connection to the rudder. Devine & I like to use the fixie analogy, with fixed-wheel bikes you have less components between the pedals and the wheels, it's the same with a tiller and rudder.</p><p>A project we were supposed to do while in Mexico, that was then only realized a year later.</p><p>The wheel, that we used to steer the boat, is kept there by a big post that is bolted through the deck. Removing the wheel, means you have to remove what is supporting it, and all of the connections leading inside the boat, steering SS cables that lead to a big quadrant (a metal wheel that is attached to the rudder post). A turn of the wheel, pulls on one of the cables, which turns the quadrant and the rudder.</p><p>Removing the wheel pedestal, Devine said to me, was easy enough. Devine had to cut through the control cables (when we have the engine running, it's what controls the engine speed), because we couldn't remove some SS screws that had merged with a piece of aluminium (happens, SS and aluminium will corrode over time) - no matter, the control cables had to be replace too anyway. The cockpit now had a large gaping hole in the floor. I went below and removed the wires connected to the quadrant (that big metal wheel attached to the rudder post), cutting away at them with a hacksaw in the dark, in a tiny cramped space. We taped up the underside of the holes, and filled them up from the top with epoxy. Just in time too, because the rain in Whangarei always comes.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.throttle.3.jpg'/>");
add_part(&pino__projects_and_pain, "Conversion to tiller steering", "<p>We had a tiller for Pino already, that we'd bought at the same time as the wind vane at a scrapyard in Sonoma CA. The tiller head fit with ours well enough, but ideally, we'd have to make a new one so that the tiller can be made to go lower, currently, it stands quite high, but it doesn't really change much for driving.</p><p>Switching from wheel to tiller, meant we had to install both a new throttle lever, and compass. Both of these things were part of the pedestal with the wheel before.</p><p>We replaced our old control cables too, which had split and rusted in part, and bought new and longer ones. We routed them to their new place on the port side, in front of the aft locker. Peeking at the place we would have to install the throttle from inside boat, after opening the wall up, we discovered there wasn't enough room to install it there. There wasn't enough height for the cables to bend at a good angle, if the angle is too extreme it can damage them overtime.</p><p>We decided then, to install it on the starboard side, access was easier, we could get at it from inside a locker.</p><p>The two-lever throttle we bought, although very shiny, turned out to be a great big piece of junk. It came with no installation guide, bore no name, no way to find information about it online. We made a hole for it, and installed it, but the lever was super wobbly, we couldn't imagine going to sea with this.</p><p>We returned it to <b>All Marine</b>, saying just this, that it was a giant piece of crap, which they confirmed, and they let us exchange it for another, more expensive, and better model. I guess they knew it was shit? Why keep it in stock then?</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.throttle.1.jpg'/><p>We bought a single-lever throttle, a <a href='http://discount-marine.co.nz/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=7069' target='_blank' class='external'>Ultraflex B85 side mount</a>. The issue now though, was that we'd already made a big hole, and this one needed an even bigger hole. We were able to drill a good hole, a bit offset, that lined with the outer edge of the old one. Doing this wasn't easy, every project requires a different sized hole, and buying a new bit is expensive, and kind of ridiculous - how often will we be making holes this size in our boat? Not too often I hope. We found a used tools shop in Whangarei up Walton street, and were able to borrow a proper sized bit there - yea, borrow, they suggested it. We installed the throttle lever, and its backing, and routed the acceleration cables through Pino's insides and over to the engine room, with much swearing and difficulty.</p><p>Pino could go forward again! YAY. I did make a mistake though, of not securing one of the two control cables on the engine well enough, the effect was that as soon as the engine was on, we'd go forward. The cable came off as we were going forward, and stayed stuck in that position. When we set the anchor, we usually rev the engine to go back to make sure its set, if we tried to go backward we'd go forward instead, but didn't notice it the first time, blaming it on the wind or current in the bay where we happened to be.</p><p>It's not really a big deal, it was windy out, and that alone helped to set our anchor. We fixed it after the second time we tried to anchor, clearly noticing then, that we were moving forward even if the throttle was pointing backward, even in neutral. It was just a matter of reconnecting the cables, and to ensure that the bolts were tight.</p>");
add_part(&pino__projects_and_pain, "Compass and anchor", "<img src='../media/blog/nz2.throttle.2.jpg'/><p>We still had more holes to make after this, for our compass, on the port side bulkhead (a dividing wall or barrier between separate compartments inside a ship) on the cabin front. We ordered one online, a small white <a href='https://www.keoghsmarine.com.au/COMPASSES-Flush-Mount-Compasses-Ritchie-Compasses' target='_blank' class='external'>Ritchie bulkhead compass</a>.</p><p>The bit we had before was too big, we returned it to the used tool places, our boat neighbor had a few, but not exactly the right size. We borrowed one, that was very, very near our desired diameter, and figured we could sand the rest.</p><p>That turned into a 2-hour long sanding game, sand sand sand, try the compass, nope, sand sand sand. We did fit it eventually, and connected it inside. We realized then that the damned thing didn't come with an LED, we'd looked at so many models, and forgot to make sure it came with it.</p><p>During this time, our old pedestal lay on deck, we didn't know what to do with it. We considered selling it, but couldn't be bothered, we had little energy at this point. We decided to bring it to <b>Stanley Marine</b>, a used boat gear shop. Devine had an idea, and asked if we could exchange the pedestal and wheel, for an old <b>15kg Rocna</b> we'd seen lying around the back. The owner didn't mind this, so we left Pino's old wheel there, and returned with a heavier anchor! Score!</p><p><b>Takeaway</b>: Don't cheap out on important boat parts, the throttle lever we saw initially looked good at first glance, but was shit. Spending more will not always guarantee quality, but in this case it did. The tiller we bought in Sonoma, is for a boat that has a tiller-post hole that is low on deck, it has a curved shaped, and it sized for a bigger boat than ours - we didn't realize this at the time. It still fits, and works well, but if you change your boat from wheel to tiller, mind the shape of the tiller as well as the tiller-head shape.</p><p><b>Throttle</b> 250$ <br><b>Control cables</b> 130$ <br><b>Compass</b> 130$ <br><b>Total</b> 4050$</p>");

The backing piece was still there at least, we didn't have too many options, and put a hose clamp, and shoved bits between it and the slides to keep it centred, before covering it all with duct tape.

add_part(&pino__projects_and_pain, "Rigging", "<img src='../media/blog/nz2.rigging.1.jpg'/><p>Again, while in Tonga, our friend Alex came over to talk to us, and standing in his dinghy from the water, noticed a cut in our port side <a href='https://www.sailboat-cruising.com/sailboat-rigging.html' target='_blank' class='external'>intermediate shroud</a>. An intermediate shroud, is one of many wires that are holding up the mast. This one, leads above the second spreader (a spar, that deflects the shrouds) on the side of the mast. Our boat has two sets of spreaders, because we have a very tall mast - not everyone has intermediate shrouds. The cut was just near the lock (the part that squeezes, and connects the wire to the turnbuckle), a single cut in one of the strands. This was bad news. We had it fixed, temporarily, cutting the wire and adding a second turnbuckle - with Herbert's help (thank you sensei). We needed to fix this, and while in Whangarei, thought we'd replace the port side intermediate and the backstay (a wire from the mast that leads to the back of the boat) as well. We had an insulated backstay, the electrical isolation of a section of wire, but no SSB (single side band radio)onboard, and no intention of having one, so we replaced the whole thing. We were told that this could be a potential breaking point too, this made us more sure of this decision.</p><p>We removed our intermediate shrouds, securing the mast with halyards (lines used to hoist sails up) on both sides, our mast is keel-stepped though, mean that it goes through the deck and goes inside the cabin. We coiled the wires up, and carried them to <b>C-spar</b> at Dockland 5 by bike.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.rigging.4.jpg'/><p>Daniel, a rigger and friend, was kind enough to deliver the new wires, since he was in the area. We found out later that Daniel was husband to <b>Laura Dekker</b>, funny, since <b>S/V Guppy</b> sat diagonally to us on the pile moorings.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.rigging.2.jpg'/>");
add_part(&pino__projects_and_pain, "T terminal hack", "<p>The issue with replacing the intermediate shrouds though, was that the T-terminals they had were too big to fit in the backing plates of our mast. A t-terminal is a piece at the top of end of the wire, shaped like a T (as the name suggests), that fits into a backing plate that is attached in your mast with rivets (a permanent mechanical fastener). The backing plate is in a hole, in your mast, and has a little elongated slot for the T to fit into, it fits at an angle and when turned the little arms of the T keep it in place.</p><p>Daniel came over to take a look, and ended up drilling the rivets out of the starboard side backing plate to get it out, so they could see how to fit the terminals into them back in the shop. The T-terminals were shaved down slightly, and the hole in the backing plate made bigger, with much care, using a drill and bit.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.rigging.5.jpg'/><p>The backing plate was installed again, but it took some time before we could do that. We needed an air compressor, to use a gun to get them back on there. As it turns out, our rivets are big, and doing it by hand near impossible - on a pile mooring, there was no way to power that compressor. We waited till our haul out to do it, since C-spar was at that yard, and that they could bring the compressor there to do it. This is what happened. Daniel climbed up the mast while the boat was on hardstand, this wasn't our idea, but then again, the cradles were made strong, better than how they do it in BC. It seemed safe enough, there was little chance that the boat would tip over. It's always better to go up the mast while in the water, since the boat has righting ability, and won't risk tipping.</p><p>Once the backing plate was back in, I hauled Devine up the mast (when back in the Town basin), and he widened the backing plate, same as the other one. This was tricky, because our drill has a cord. We connected the drill to a long extension, and then to the generator on deck. We were able to replace both intermediate shrouds then. We had to do this quick, cause Devine had trouble holding the weight of the drill, and the whole length of the extension aloft.</p><p>The backstay was easier to do, but was heavier to carry by bike. The new wire would be lighter, without the insulated part. Our other wires, we deemed good enough. No cuts. We'd wait until our return to BC to replace them, that, with the running rigging.</p><p><b>Takeaway</b>: Re-doing your rigging at a dock is much easier, much, much easier. Having access to shore power would have been handy. I bought norseman cones online from rig-rite, had them shipped from the US for way too much money. Avoid rig-rite if you can, their service is shit and they'll charge you a ridiculously high amount to ship the part without warning you of it.

We didn't want to order from the US, and thought we'd go to a local sail loft to ask if they could make the cuts for us.</p><p>We believed we could do it, and even asked for the advice of <b>UK sails</b>. They were glad of our interest in this, and even gave us a stack of old needles to try in our sewing machine, as well as a slab of thick sail to do tests on. Unfortunately, our thrift store machine did not prove worthy of the task. But also, this, along with all the work we'd already done, was just too much. We had much ambition, but little time and energy.</p><p>Sails can last a long, long time, so we put in the money to get it done right in the end.</p><p>We tend to get carried away in our ideas, while I would like to sow up my own sail someday, now wasn't the time to experiment. We needed something solid, something that could get us through the hard sailing we'd have to do the next year.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.sail.2.jpg'/><p>We carried our old main over to UK sails, and chatted about what we wanted for our new main. We opted for a loose-footed sail (a sail that doesn't run in a track on the boom, only attached by two points), full-batten (made with pockets for long battens, that help keep the shape of the sail), 3 reefs (reinforced points of attachment, that you put lines through, and that you use to keep the sail down and tied when making the sail smaller in big winds), thick, with a black circle stuck to both sides. We don't have a staysail, a thick and small storm sail that is used instead of the mainsail in big weather, so we thought that this thicker main, with a third reef, could act as that. The people at UK sails were so damn nice to us, answering all our questions, and letting us film the process. We also had our jib (our headsail) re-stitched, we couldn't really afford to get this one replaced entirely, but it's still good and strong.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.sail.3.jpg'/><p><b>Take away</b>: DIY is great if you have time. Sailmaking is intricate work, hard to get right, especially in a small cramped space. I think we could have succeeded, but again, this wasn't the time for experimenting. Pino needs a good set of wings, it is our main means of propulsion after all.

'AIS stands for 'automatic identification system', it's an automatic tracking system used on ships and by vessel traffic services. AIS information supplements marine radar, which continues to be the primary method of collision avoidance for water transport (definition sourced from wikipedia).'</p><p>There is a lot of traffic in Japanese waters, making it necessary to be seen by other means. We have radar, but it uses more power than AIS to function, with radar we can know that something is out there, but we don't know the boat's name, size or heading. AIS provides all of this information, with it, you can call a boat by name on the radio if need be, and they, can see you and call you as well if you have a transponder (a device that transmits your boat's information).</p><p>Our first idea, was to DIY this (this is a common theme in this post isn't it?) with a <a href='https://www.tindie.com/products/astuder/daisy-hat-ais-receiver-for-raspberry-pi/' target='_blank' class='external'>Raspberry Pi Daisy hat</a>.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.ais.3.jpg'/><p>This Raspberry Pi project turned out to be too big of a leap.

The unit itself is costly, but made worse by the fact that you need to buy a splitter to connect it to the VHF antenna. A splitter removes the need for a separate VHF antenna for an AIS receiver or transponder and allows a single antenna to be shared with a VHF radio. The antenna splitter also provides signal gain, improving AIS reception and range. The unit we got, has a low-noise amplifier, it helps to get a good signal on smaller lower power devices that are transmitting out there.</p><p>We walked out of there, wide-eyed, half-regretting.

We routed the wires from the back rail of the boat, inside the radar post, through the cockpit locker, under the flooring, through the ceiling, and down over to the port side breaker panels. Easy? Not really. Pino has a lot of extra wiring, that leads to nothing, junk that was left hanging in the boat by previous owners and that we haven't bothered to remove because of how shitty a job it is. There's still old GPS, SSB, modem wires running through here. We set up the antenna outside, on the rail, and the unit inside the breaker panel, stuck to the back wall with the splitter. Connecting it, and setting it up, was simple - how rare.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.ais.2.jpg'/><p>After installing it, and spending some time at sea with it, we were happy to have it. One night we had forty knots at our backs, there were big seas, a ship lay in front of us, too close. My eyes couldn't see them in the night. We were running downwind and could not manoeuvre so well, and the other ship was a power boat, going real slow. We were surfing at 8 knots, we'd catch up in no time. I saw them on AIS, saw their name, gave them a call to warn them of our passing, we weren't going to run into them, but we'd pass awful close.

There are many more things we wanted to change aboard, like changing our head to a composting head, changing to a manual windlass, removing a lot of old wiring and things we no longer use like our water heater etc. Removing the head, would mean making additional room for water, that would have been good for this trip but again, we had to prioritize.</p><p>We made a lot of mistakes, and foolishly thought we could all do it ourselves. While I prefer to do that most times, it's not always possible. We had too much on our shoulders already, we didn't need the stress. We did do a lot of it on our own, and even the things we had help with, we took part in in some way. Learning to do it all yourself is important, but we are no experts, we'll continue to learn and when we've got more time and room to experiment we'll try and do these things on our own. It's important to ask for help though, there is a lot of value in having a mentor around, not something that is common these days. Our mentors, are all the sailors we meet, and that take time, sitting with us, answering our questions, or ever coming to help us in the task we need to do.</p><p>I'll close this post, by thanking all in NZ who helped us out, for repairs, general advice - whatever.

Because staying in the Whangarei Town Basin is inexpensive, convenient, with everything just a short walk away. We'd also read that it was a good place for boat projects, and since Pino needed a lot of attention, this too, we thought, tipped the scale in its favor.

We became very familiar with that stretch of land, and of the actual distance between the two places during the 8 months we spent there.</p><p>The first thing we did when we arrived, was to replenish our store of dried goods at Bin Inn, a really great bulk food store. The second thing, was purchasing a home brew kit - priorities amirite?

The sailing culture is strong in Aotearoa.</p><p>We sailed down from Whangarei, making a stop for the night in <b>Urquharts Bay</b>. While there, a couple on a dinghy came over, a couple came to say hello because they recognized our boat.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz10.jpg'/><ul><li>'We used to have a Yamaha 36!'</li></ul><p>They said to us, excited to see our boat here in the bay.</p><ul><li>'We've been here in new zealand for a long while, and have sold the boat some time ago. Yamahas are good boats!'</li></ul><p>That's something we hear a lot, that Yamahas are sturdy boats. It brought us here, to New Zealand from Canada, so it must be good! Their current boat was an aluminium yacht, beautiful, unpainted grey hull. That's a dream we have, Devine & I, to have a yacht like that for high latitude sailing.</p><p>A dream for later times.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz4.jpg'/><p>Early the next morning, Pino spread its wings and we sailed down to <b>Kawau Island</b>. All the bays there were cluttered with moorings, but Pino's not a big boat and were able to secure a place in North cove. Unlike the Whangarei Town basin, the water here was blue, not clear, but wonderful shades of turquoise. I learned later that this is where my heroine <a href='resources.html' target='_self' class='local'>Lin Pardey</a> lives.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz1.jpg'/><p>Next, we sailed to Pakatoa. We found a place to anchor there, Dom was already there on his boat, and kayaked over to say hello. Soon, the rest of the flotilla arrived, Rocinante, with Tece and Emre, Festina Lente, with Helena and Joran, and then came Elliot and Neftaly. Robin and Courtenay aboard spaceship Tangaroa could not join us, but we kept them in memory. The Ephemeral yacht club was not whole. Pino was, in that moment, the biggest fish in the fleet at 10m.</p><p>Crazy, we thought, there's a first time for everything.</p>");
add_part(&an_island_to_oneself, "A private island tour", "<p>We soon went ashore for a guided tour of the island. Pakatoa is a private island, a bird sanctuary, you can go ashore, provided you have the permission of the caretaker Nigel. We got to go, because our friend knew him. The place was full of abandoned bungalows and free-roaming wekas — a flightess bird, endemic to New Zealand.</p><p>My name, 'Rekka', is close to weka. Found myself thinking in Elmer Fudd's voice for the rest of the day.</p><ul><li>'Kill the wa-bbit, kill the wa-bbit!'.</li></ul><p>Pakatoa used to be a resort in the 60's, and was abandoned and left as is. We had a walk inside the bungalows, there are 60 of them on the island, all were standing, some looking better than others. We couldn't help but think of what we could do with this island if we owned it, we could build an off-grid community of artists!</p><img src='../media/blog/nz18.jpg'/><p>Walking around the yard, we saw giants balls of metal, heavy moorings maybe, although, they resembled explosive mines. Then, came the graveyard of disused items, old furniture, kitchen ware, a pile of old stoves sat on one side.</p><ul><li>'Look at those!' Devine said.</li></ul><p>Dom began to list the merits of the Countess stoves, like a proper salesman, to the merriment of Devine who listened, laughing.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz16.jpg'/><p>Nigel brought us to a collection of tall silos, claiming that up there, we could have the best view of the island. He set a ladder up to one of the silos, and one-by-one we climbed up onto it. It stood high off the ground, while scary - for me at least - it did prove to be a worthwhile climb. The view was amazing. From here, we could see our boats in the anchorage below, with moving crescents in the water created by the oncoming gusts of wind.</p><ul><li>'Might want to tuck your boat in closer inland' the caretaker told us.</li></ul><p>We could see from here that we had anchored Pino a bit further out than everyone else, things look closer than they appear when you're down there.</p><ul><li>'Wind's rising.'</li></ul>");
add_part(&an_island_to_oneself, "On buying an island", "<p>Then, we began talking about the logistics of buying an island such as this, or how it would be to manage a community of people living here. It was all too easy to imagine - it could work, couldn't it?</p><img src='../media/blog/nz11.jpg'/><p>Some of the old bungalows could be repurposed, the materials were still good. Getting goods on and off the island would be a challenge, a boat would be necessary, but we had that part covered. The hardest thing to do in a new, and large community of people, is to agree on rules, on a code of conduct. This is something we really did like to think about, wondering then if anyone like us had ever attempted to make an offer on the island. It was clear that the owner wasn't keen on selling it especially, Nigel mentioned there being no shortage of offers from wealthy buyers. We imagined then, speaking to the owner...</p><ul><li>'Hey, we don't have any money to buy the island, but could we just, y'know, have it?'</li></ul><p>Bet no one's asked him that before. Ballsy much?</p><ul><li>'So you want my million dollar island, for free?'</li><li>'Yep! Exactly that. Thank you.'</li></ul><p>With images of an island of our own, we each climbed back down from the silo, imaginations aflutter.</p><p>We strolled into the main resort complex next. The first building, was the game room. Devine and Elliot played Ping Pong, and squash in the old court, the sound of their playing resonating throughout.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz5.jpg'/><p>Devine looked at an old desk, covered with a thick film of dust and made a print of a hand on it, then traced the word 'witch' on top of it with a finger, a-la-silent hill. Any moment now, the sirens would blare, the sky would darken with the paint coming off the walls to reveal their caged innards, and pyramid head would come strolling in, death in his heart.</p><ul><li>'Maybe he'd like ping pong.'</li></ul><p>I thought then.</p><p>This place had an eerie quality to it. The room keys were all set on their hooks, never to be used again. A computer room, with old computers and discs, amassed cobwebs, close to that a bar, bottles of spirits intact, undrunk. There was also a stack of old Pakatoa money, the island's own currency. The pool was empty and thirsty, ghosts of tourists walking about and taking turns on the dive board.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz13.jpg'/><p>What an amazing island. Once alive, now dormant, locked in time for the unforeseeable future.</p>");
add_part(&an_island_to_oneself, "Bbq on the beach", "<p>We spent the evening on the beach, making a fire and roasting vegetables on a hot place that we set atop of it. The caretaker sat with us.</p><ul><li>'First time I've ever seen people roasting JUST vegetables on this plate.' he said.</li></ul><p>I smiled at this. We had a wild assortment of capsicum, kumara, onions... no meat or fish to be seen. This, was the best ever bbq.</p><p>I watched sand bugs, leap all too near to the flames before popping out of existence. The fire was the only source of light, aside from the stars, which we could see clearly from where we stood.</p><p>We heard excited laughs on the beach.</p><ul><li>'This...this is amazing!'</li></ul><p>We'd hear.</p><ul><li>'YOU GUYS! You HAVE to come and see this!'</li></ul><p>Someone realized that the sand on the beach had bioluminescence. We'd experienced this many times in the past, in water, when splashing around in it, but never in sand. It's a phenomenon I've also observed while flushing the head, waste swirling downward into a flurry of bright green sparks - toilet magic. All of us began to walk in the dark, watching as every step expanded outward with a green glow. It was unreal. An amazing spectral display, like an interactive installation, the ground drawing up color and light with every contact. By then, Joran, Elliot and Helena had gone for a swim, they laughed and splashed around, their movements clear to us in the dark because of the green glow.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz12.jpg'/><p>The next day, we awoke early and had coffee with Nigel. I brought fresh pitas I'd made, and had them with the gift of pekmez (mix of tahini and fruit molasses) from Tece and Emre. What a great place to wake up to, I thought then, as I sat on the porch, warm cup in hand.</p><p>Before we left, many thanks were said to the caretaker, for allowing us to see this wonderful place. Don't think I've seen anything quite like it.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz2.jpg'/>");
add_part(&an_island_to_oneself, "Race to Waiheke", "<p>We set sail to <b>Waiheke</b> next, making a race of it, well, it wasn't a race until Dom raised his spinnaker. The black sail billowed ahead of his boat, and gave him great speed, we decided to do the same. Our gennaker was hoisted, freed, its wrinkles smoothed out for the first time in a long while. Pakatoa disappeared in the distance.</p><ul><li>'We'll be back,' I said, 'we'll make a home of you yet!'</li></ul>");
add_part(&an_island_to_oneself, "Our second home", "<p>We returned to Whangarei, just in time for the beginning of the good weather. That summer, we had highs of 30, and through a hole in the ozone, the unobstructed new zealand sun burned our skin if exposed without protection. Whangarei resembled the city of Sidney on Vancouver Island, small, but with everything near, just a short walk away. Also conveniently near, was a complex network of forest walks. We could walk 10 minutes and arrive in <b>Mair park</b>, and another 30 minutes would take us to a waterfall, and tall Kauri trees.</p><p>We walked in silence, listening to the song of the Tuis, clicks, cackles, timber-like creaks, and other sounds unheard by human ears, beyond our register.</p><p>Another walk we much enjoyed, was 'the loop', going through town, over to the bascule bridge and across it. The walk would take an hour to do, would take us right back to the Town Basin and was pleasant. At low-tide, we saw the long-legged birds with their thin beaks, poking into the mud for food. At high-tide, came eels undulating in the water, and cormorants swimming just under the surface in groups. Past the bascule bridge, was an field, empty, if it weren't for the local <a href='http://kokorobot.ca/#animals' target='_blank' class='external'>Pukekos</a>. Their blue bodies stood clear against the dry yellow, and greenish grasses, as did their bright orange beaks. These, along with the <a href='http://kokorobot.ca/#animals' target='_blank' class='external'>Kāruhiruhi</a> were our favorites.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz6.jpg'/><p>I didn't care much for birds before we started sailing, but now I look for them wherever I go. New zealand is the best place for one who likes birds. Before humans came and messed it all up, this land was kingdom to birds. I like to imagine what the world was like then, when the giant Moas walked the earth, hunted by an even bigger winged being, the Haast eagles.</p><p>Much of the places we've been in New Zealand, have left a lasting impression on us. From the sulphuric mud pools of <b>Rotorua</b>, to Tauranga's towering, <b>mount Maunganui</b>. The <b>Te papa museum</b> in <b>Wellington</b>, and the <a href='https://www.tepapa.govt.nz/visit/exhibitions/gallipoli-scale-our-war' target='_blank' class='external'>giant soldiers of Gallipoli</a>, left a lasting lump in my throat.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz7.jpg'/><p>The walks in and around <b>Tutukaka</b> we aren't close to forgetting. Long beaches, leading to tall mounts, whose summits reveal exquisite, and unique views of the world. Paths that can only be crossed at low-tide, made dangerous by the passage of water.</p><p>Nature is strong here, and the paths are wild enough that you forget at times that there is a city just a short distance away.</p><p>It would be very easy to make a home here, we thought, it's similar to Canada in many ways. The problem is we're not quite ready to settle anywhere just yet, but like many of the places we've been this becomes another option for us, another place to be. New Zealand is a strong candidate.</p><p>We loved our time there, and the people we've met that made us feel all too welcome.</p><img src='../media/blog/nz19.jpg'/><p>We will be back, perhaps aboard an alu-hulled yacht, maybe with a plan to get an island for zero cash. We have plenty of plans for the future, that is one thing we're never short on.</p><p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq5BOsgO_4k' target='_blank' class='external'>Watch a video</a> of our time in Pakatoa.</p>");

add_part(&captain__what_is_this, "Nakama creek", "<p>After 15 days on the water, you can imagine how eager we were to get into port. It was the 27th of June, we left on the 12th from Opua. We hove-to for the night, waiting for sunrise before entering <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savusavu' target='_blank' class='external'>Savusavu bay</a>. After repeated mistakes, we learned that entering a strange harbor in the dark is most unwise. There is no point in arriving early, considering yachts cannot anchor in Fiji waters before checking in, and check-in is only possible after 8am.</p><p>At dawn, we pointed towards Vanua Levu and started sailing again, the wind at our backs. I went below to make some coffee, both of us needed a boost. Devine was in the cockpit, keeping a wary eye on a large storm cloud ahead. The wind increased as we neared it, but it did not trouble us long. We made our way inside the reef, which offered some protection from the building swells. Now closer to land, we could see rows of hills ahead, and caught the perfume of greenery with it. After that, came a sure sign of civilization: buildings, low, with green and red roofs. As we got nearer, came an even more obvious marker of civilization: cars, and small power boats. We'd arrived.</p><p>We neared the entrance to Nakama creek around 9am, and radio'ed the authorities on channel 16.</p><ul><li>'Savusavu port authority, Savusavu port authority, this is sailing vessel Pino, over.'</li></ul><p>This, I repeated 3 times, no answer. We slowed down, awaiting a reply. The commercial wharf lay ahead, we could see boats on moorings, some abandoned, others belonging to people we'd seen or met accross the pacific.</p><ul><li>'Sailing vessel Pino, this is Coprashed marina. There is no port authority in Savusavu, how can I help you today?'</li><li>'We're looking to check in,' I said.</li><li>'Where did you sail from?'</li><li>'Opua, New Zealand.'</li><li>'Did you send your advance arrival notice?'</li><li>'I did send it yes, and received confirmation for it too.'</li></ul><p>We'd heard they were all too severe about the advance arrival notice, which was about 10 pages too long. I'd sent it to the proper people by email, although half of the messages bounced back and other cruisers reported the same thing happening. With the document being so large, it's no wonder their inboxes are always full. I even tried again while underway, no luck. No matter, I'd received a reply from the custom office, at least one of the messages made it.</p><ul><li>'Continue into the harbor, past the wharf, and over to our building which stands on your starboard side. It is a white building. Once you arrive closer hail us again.'</li></ul>");
add_part(&captain__what_is_this, "Coprashed marina", "<img src='../media/blog/savusavu3.jpg'/><p>We moved deeper into the creek, looking for a white building on the shore. Once we were past the wharf I called them again, they mentioned a dock and instructed us to tie to it. I didn't expect to have to dock the boat, from what we'd read online we didn't have to do that! Things do change from year to year, and from boat to boat. The fenders weren't ready, and neither were the docking lines. I ran around the boat, gathering everything, all the while trying to figure out where that damned dock was. We spotted one ahead then, with a ramp, but with no building near it.</p><ul><li>'Do you think that's it?'</li><li>'I don't know – looks shallow, plus there's people with dive suits on it. It's probably for the locals.'</li></ul><p>We glimpsed another free dock further ahead, a finger, part of the marina, it looked like a regular slip. Getting there meant moving inbetween a few boats, channel markers and moorings – the floating dock seemed a better option in comparison. Then, we saw two persons on the marina finger, waving us over. This is where we'd have to dock. Docking is always a nerve-wrecking experience, we didn't have current to contend with but perpendicular to the dock, was a large power boat, with nothing between it and our bow. If we came in too fast, we'd bump into it for sure – bumping into still objects is always embarassing. I was still attaching fenders at this point, while Devine manoeuvered Pino around various obstacles.</p><img src='../media/blog/savusavu6.jpg'/><ul><li>'Sailing vessel Pino, this is Coprashed marina.'</li></ul><p>They couldn't have picked a worse time to hail us, the dock lay ahead and two of the lines weren't yet set up. I ran inside, sweating from all the running, it was also 26C out, and I was in full foul-weather gear. Couldn't they see that we were right there and that they could ask us questions later?</p><ul><li>'This is Pino.'</li></ul><p>I said to them on the radio, trying to peel part of my foul weather gear off because I was cooking inside it.</p><ul><li>'Where was your last port again?'</li><li>'Opua, New Zealand,' I said.</li></ul><p>I shut off the VHF off, determined to not answer if they asked anything else. I darted back outside. We were right near the quarantine dock, I set up the last two dock lines, and threw the ends to the marina staff. We slowed to a stop, our bow drawing all too near to the boat ahead. I noticed then, the name on its side, a New Zealand boat, we'd seen them power past us on AIS on the way up here.</p><p>All went well in the end, Pino was at the dock and we could relax. The marina staff were friendly, one of the line handlers shook our hand.</p><ul><li>'Bula! Bula! Welcome to Savusavu!'</li><li>'Bula!' we repeated.</li></ul><p>We wished we'd bothered to learn some Fijian before arriving here. Bula could mean welcome, or hello, we hoped for the latter, us repeating 'Welcome!' would be awkward indeed.</p>");
add_part(&captain__what_is_this, "Long line of officials", "<p>We waited for the proper authorities to visit, and noticed then that the new zealand power boat had bands of yellow with 'crime scene' written all over it.</p><ul><li>'Is that what happens when they find undeclared veggies aboard?'</li></ul><p>We wondered, all the while becoming paranoid about the bit of ginger and pumpkin we'd hidden away. We saw police walking the docks, everyone we'd met so far was all smiles, but these guys looked serious. They wandered off for a second, I stepped off Pino, moving a short distance away, to try and take a photo of Devine and the boat to show others we'd arrived. I took a photo, but a second after, Devine motioned for me to return, a marina attendant was walking towards us as if to say that we had to stay on the boat. With the stone-faced police walking about, it was best to heed their warning.</p><img src='../media/blog/savusavu.jpg'/><p>It was some time before the authorities came to see us. The first, in the long line of officials, was the health inspector. He was a friendly fellow, dressed in casual wear, a colorful blouse and sandals. He had us sign and fill papers – writing down Pino's info and our passport numbers is second nature now.</p><ul><li>'Is it just you two? Did anyone die aboard this vessel?'</li><li>'Uh, yes and no.'</li></ul><img src='../media/blog/savusavu4.jpg'/><p>Important not to get those mixed up.</p><ul><li>'Any animals? Insects?'</li><li>'Do sea birds count?'</li></ul><p>I did not say this aloud, but at sea, the thought of having a gannet friend always crossed my mind.</p><ul><li>'No animals, no.'</li></ul><p>Saying this, my mind screamed 'gannet friend' over and over again.</p><ul><li>The officer nodded. 'Are you sick?'</li><li>'No.'</li><li>'Are you sure?'</li><li>'No. I mean, yes! Sure! So sure. We're so healthy.'</li></ul><p>I could see him writing this down now, Rekka and Devine: 'so healthy'. He then began to talk to us about the mosquitoe situation. While Fiji doesn't have it as bad as other places, there have been instances of dengue. Ah, dengue, we'd first heard of it while in Japan, there was an outbreak and no one could visit the parks. I didn't know what it was back then, just that it's something you didn't want to get. Since then, we came to be very familiar with dengue, Devine contracted it in Nuku Hiva. You can say we weren't keen on a repeat, dengue is no joke. The health officer wanted to make sure we understood that.</p><ul><li>'Fiji doesn't want you sick.' Fair enough.</li></ul><p>Then, we had a visit from the quarantine officer, an indian-fijian, who was very excited to hear that we didn't consume dairy or animals. He admitted to consumming some meat, and aspired to lessen it to none. We had a long conversation about this, and even showed him a book we had on cooking in India. We spoke about the consumption of meat, and he mentioned a lot of the health risks associated with it. Like in the west, people in Fiji too suffered because of it. I'd almost finished filling out papers, when two fijian women arrived with more. They were the customs and bio security officials. They asked to come inside. The boat was a mess, I went in and shoved everything we had in the v-berth to make room in the saloon. I also set up the table, since it appeared as though we had many more documents to fill – yay.</p>");
add_part(&captain__what_is_this, "A thorough search", "<p>The two women gave us the first wave of sheets to read and sign, and began to look through our lockers, asking us questions about our stores. One of them took our passports, and began to look through every page, matching the exit stamps with what we'd written on our advance arrival notice.</p><ul><li>'You came from Opua.'</li><li>'Yes.'</li><li>'Before this?'</li><li>'Tonga.'</li><li>'Before this?'</li><li>'Niue, cook islands, french polynesia, mexico, USA and then Canada.'</li></ul><p>She looked for the stamps in our passports.</p><ul><li>'Where is the mexico stamp?'</li></ul><p>Mexico and US don't stamp Canadian passports on entry and exit, it's how it is, but it was hard to make her understand this. The other woman was opening every locker, pulling out bags and asking us questions about their contents.</p><ul><li>'Captain, what is this?'</li><li>'Lots and lots of coffee.'</li><li>'Beans?'</li><li>'Yes, it's better kept as beans.'</li></ul><p>Then the quarantine officer pushed another paper for us to sign, all while making a mess of our galley (our boat kitchen) and asking questions about where we'd been. It was a dizzying experience, having so many people aboard, with the table covered in pieces of writing: 'sign this, sign that!' This moment, was made even more chaotic, with them exchanging pleasantries (we hope) in Fijian. Devine and I smiled at one another, what a strange scene, sometimes they didn't even pay attention to us at all.</p><ul><li>'So, you left from Mexico when?' one of the women asked.</li></ul><p>She was inspecting every inch of our passports and had noticed how the numbers on our passports followed each other, and decided that this was suspicious. It is odd, but it's what happens when you have new passports processed together.</p><ul><li>'Captain.'</li></ul><p>The other woman began, she was on her hands and knees, head under the sink. She pulled away, holding the end of a hose with a bottle of mexican dry salsa wedged into it.</p><ul><li>'What is this?'</li></ul><p>In Rarotonga, we disconnected the water pressure hoses since we no longer had a pressure faucet. We didn't have any plugs around the boat to close them up, but what we did have, were many sample-sized bottles of mexican dry salsa, or Tajín. The bottle end was a perfect fit, and we'd since forgotten to replace them with something else.</p><p>Devine and I looked at each other, supressing a laugh, we never thought we'd ever have to justify this crappy fix to anyone. Now we had 3 Fijian officials onboard, all looking at the bottle of salsa en polvo, waiting for an explanation.</p>");
add_part(&captain__what_is_this, "A crime scene", "<ul><li>'It's dry salsa, from Mexico.'</li></ul><p>They said nothing, and didn't ask any more about it, which was good considering there was little more we did want to say. I'm sure they've stumbled upon worse things, or it's possible that all foreign yachts stuff salsa bottles, or other oddities up their hoses.</p><p>We thought they'd only be looking through the galley cupboards and lockers, but they decided they needed to look through everything, and I do mean everything. I remembered then the pumpkin and ginger root we'd hidden, one lay under clothes in a bin, the other stuffed deep inside our dirty laundry bag. We hadn't mentioned we had these left-over, because we wanted to eat them – I care deeply about my rhizomes and squashes. I became paranoid, would they fine us for not declaring them? I could see it now, one of the women pulling a large pumpkin out of our laundry bag, eyes on us and asking, 'Captain, what is this?'.</p><p>They looked in our bilge, under the settee cushions, and in all the bags stacked up in the quarter berth too. All the while, getting nearer to the v-berth, where I had my illegal vegetables. They looked in the head, and at the plastic bags of medicines we'd inherited from Asma and Herbert from Maya. They didn't care about most of the medicines we had, but the woman did find a stack of sealed needles.</p><ul><li>'Captain, what is this?'</li><li>'They're needles.'</li><li>'Why so many?'</li></ul><p>I wished I could remember why Maya had this many so I could repeat and sound like I knew what I was talking about. I didn't know what to say, but no matter, the woman found some other item of interest: our tattoo needles.</p><ul><li>'It's for tattoos.'</li></ul><p>Then we showed them a plastic box with our tattoo machine and gear.</p><ul><li>'Do you like tattoos?' Devine asked.</li></ul><p>The woman looked at Devine's neck, and at my arm.</p><ul><li>'No' she said, unimpressed.</li></ul><p>The other official began telling me if I knew how to remove tattoos, as if to make sure I knew there were options in case I did change my mind about having them. This was a big contrast to the people in French Polynesia, who gave us a thumbs up as we walked past.</p><p>The officials spent a lot of time on Pino, they were a pleasant bunch but at this point in the day we were running on fumes. We'd slept 3 hours that night, this, plus the accumulated exhaustion from 15 days of sailing. They did leave eventually, and didn't bother checking out the v-berth. By then, we'd decided they cared little about our secret stash of veggies. We later found out that the reason they did such a thorough search, was because the owners of the boat that arrived before us, the one with the 'crime scene' tape, were in jail for arriving into the country with undeclared ammunition.</p>");
add_part(&captain__what_is_this, "A first look at Savusavu", "<img src='../media/blog/savusavu2.jpg'/><p>We made lunch, but could not sleep yet, we had fees to pay to the quarantine and health officers and had to go into town to get some money to do it. They told us where to find their respective offices, that Savusavu was a one-street town and that they'd be easy to find. They gave us general direction, we didn't take notes thinking we'd remember, severely overestimating the capabilities of our tired brains. We also moved our boat off the dock and onto a mooring, and pumped some air into Iggy the dinghy before going into town.</p><p>We were looking for a green building, but none we passed looked like a proper office. This was our first excursion into town, our first look at Fiji. The city, while small, was very animated and busy, there were people everywere. Everyone we passed waved at us, 'Bula!' We returned their wave and greeting – by now, we knew bula meant hello. We passed by an area packed with windowless buses, with vendors outside trying to sell its passengers soft drinks and snacks. Wild dogs roamed the streets, we passed a green space with people, sitting while chatting and sharing food. We caught a glimpse of the digicel booth, we'd have to come here later to get some data for our phones. The fresh vegetable market was right next to the bus station, looking very much like the one in Tonga, but bigger, with stalls selling indian staples. We couldn't wait to get some paw paw and breadfruit! The town had many stores: lots of hardware shops selling more or less the same content, a hideously pink grocery store called Max value, a chinese bakery etc.</p><img src='../media/blog/savusavu5.jpg'/>");
add_part(&captain__what_is_this, "The green building", "<p>We arrived at the edge of town then, or the part of town where the street transitions from buildings to bush, and still no health or quarantine office in sight. We remembered them saying that the customs office was on the other side of town, where there were less buildings. This one, we figured, we couldn't miss. We found it straight away, picked up our passports, and asked for directions to the health and quarantine offices again. They assured us that if we kept walking the other way, that we'd find the green building.</p><p>Devine and I dragged our tired bodies back over there, and did find a green building. The quarantice office wasn't on the street, but at the back of it. The quarantine officer took a liking to us and we talked for a long while, but our bodies longed for a rest. We must have said goodbye 10 times before he agreed to let us go. He told us how to find the health office – hopefully this time, we wouldn't forget. We walked out, and about 5 minutes into our walk, we realized that we had contradicting information.</p><ul><li>'He said it's on the left and past a round-about,' I said.</li><li>'No, he said it's on the right close to the customs office'</li></ul><p>I felt my skin getting warmer, I couldn't believe we'd forgotten again. Dead on our feet, Devine volunteered to return to ask the chatty man about the health office again.</p><p>We did eventually find it, but we did forget something again, they couldn't provide change, we had to pay the exact amount. This, they'd told us, although neither of us remembered – a feeling all too familiar at this point. We stood there, ready to drop, I considered faking a tear then too – that's how desperate I was. Our exhaustion must have been obvious to them, because he took pity on us. He went around the office, and asked other employees for change – what a guy, oh what a guy!</p><p>On the way out, we stopped by the Digicel booth to get some data. I would have preferred we'd go tomorrow, but Devine insisted on it. We took some amazing shots while becalmed on the ocean during our passage, and Devine wanted to put them online. We'd heard internet in Fiji was cheap, but we didn't expect to get 25G for 25$, this equates to 15$ cad. In Tonga, all we could get was 5G for 25$ (Tongan dollars). We couldn't believe it. The Digicel employees welcomed us to Savusavu, all the while staring at Devine's lip piercings like they weren't of this earth. We had a chat, and told them we came on a yacht, and right then all the employees turned to us.</p><ul><li>'Did you hear of the boat with weapons? Do you know what happened?'</li></ul><p>The ammunition boat was the talk of the town! They asked us about it and we told them what we knew, amused by how fast news traveled here. We left the stall, data in hand, brains melting, but walked past the market – we'd made enough stops for today. Arriving back on the boat, we made some dinner, I can't remember what we ate because seconds after eating it we passed out.</p><p>We're here, and we can sleep for more than 3 hours at a time - oh how grand a feeling!</p><p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBYXcieCxP4&t=22s' target='_blank' class='external'>Watch this video</a> of our time in <b>Savusavu</b>.</p>");

It's the first country to offer free, state-funded, wireless internet to all its residents and has a goal of being completely <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niue' target='_blank' class='external'>solar powered</a> - uh. Wow?</p><p>We'd also heard that the school gave all of the kids laptops, this, with free internet, makes it a paradise for game devs. Already then, we made plans to move there, like all places in the tropics with a good connection and supply of coconut and beer. I remember when we were speaking of staying in <b>Nuku Hiva</b> too, and in La Paz. We make a home everywhere we go. This, makes it hard to leave, but this ease of adaptation also makes us eager to go forward, to see where else we could live. This is what we do, we set up house in different places, sometimes for 8 months at a time.</p><p>We weren't going to be staying long in Niue though, but not by choice.</p><p><a href='https://www.noforeignland.com/home/map/place/5901703433945088/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1558751788482' target='_blank' class='external'>Alofi Bay</a>, the only anchorage on the island, is not protected in any wind other than east. If the wind turns in an unfavorable direction, staying could be dangerous and we'd be forced to leave.</p><p>One other troublesome thing about the 'rock of Polynesia', is that they hiked the departure fees from 35$ to 80$ per person. Anyone who enters Niue, when leaving, need pay this fee. That's a lot of money, we thought, to visit a place so small.</p><p>In the end I'm glad we went, because of all the places we'd been, Niue was our favorite.</p><p>We arrived at 6am in the morning, rounding the island to Alofi bay that lay on the west side. A squall lay between me and the anchorage, a puffy cloud with a thick wet skirt beneath it. I pulled my hood on, grabbed the helm firmly and quickly skipped through songs on my phone till I landed on anything by Purity ring. Ah! Sea castles. Yes. Perfect.</p><p>WOOSH! A gust of wind comes, but I'm ready. The song begins then too.</p><ul><li>I could build a machine.</li></ul><p>The boat heels, but I've got this!</p><ul><li>Draw pictures for the walls.</li></ul><p>Then comes the rain, heavy droplets, washing the salt crystals away. It left as quickly as it came, giving way to the sun, its face reflected in a thousand wet pools on the deck.</p><ul><li>Hang up all my fragile frights.</li></ul><p>I point Pino towards the anchorage. Tall masts ahead, signs of life. The water, a deep blue, as deep as I've ever seen it, spotted with brightly-colored floaters.</p><ul><li>'Display that you may see-'</li></ul><p>I sing aloud, turning the music off.</p><ul><li>'Devine! We're here!'</li></ul><p>The sleeper awakens.</p>");

I like to imagine we're an airship sometimes, and that we're afloat, high into the air - being afloat and aloft, the two are all too similar.</p><p>The water here is abnormally clear for its depth, water visibility can often reach 60m or more as the coral and limestone filter out sediment in the water. We'd heard that humpback whales swim in the mooring field now and again, how amazing it would be to see them with such clarity! The whales did come, under the cover of night, we could hear them surfacing near the boat but we couldn't see them. The sound of their breathing was pleasant enough. Ah, how I loved the idea of sleeping amongst giants!</p><p>Checking into Niue was simple and fast, a rare treat. They picked up Devine at the pier, along with other cruisers that had arrived that same morning, and drove everyone around to various offices to sign and complete some documents.</p><img src='../media/blog/niue5.jpg'/><p>When arriving in a new place, it is customary aboard Pino to make pancakes usually accompanied by maple syrup. We are down to one can. We promised to keep it for our arrival in New Zealand, to celebrate the completion of the 2nd leg of our pacific circumnavigation. Instead of liquid gold, we opted for bitter orange jam instead, not the same, but a good alternative.</p><p>We kept the radio on that day, and overheard a conversation between two cruisers, one had an unmistakable quebecois accent. The quebecois was speaking to another yachtie, who said they'd checked the grib files (a special binary format of weather data) that morning, and that the weather was supposed to shift to the west. As I mentioned before, staying in this unprotected anchorage in westerlies was a BAD idea.</p><ul><li>'It's going to be a real shit fest out here when that weather comes rolling in.'</li><li>'I don't see this on the grib files.' The quebecois said.</li><li>'I'm tellin' ya! Real shit fest. We've got to check out fast.'</li></ul><p>I looked at Devine.</p><ul><li>'Shit. Does that mean we have to leave? We just got here!'</li></ul><p>We had checked the weather that same morning and did not see anything coming from the west on the grib files, but now we had doubts. Devine checked again, and saw nothing different.</p><ul><li>'That can't be right. Looks clear.'</li></ul><p>We could hear them bickering on the radio still, and they agreed to meet on the pier to discuss it further. We thought it a good idea to go, to try and untangle this mess. As it turned out, this was a mistake - phew! Somehow, one of them messed something up while checking the gribs. We had plenty of good weather, and time to explore the island after all!</p><img src='../media/blog/niue3.jpg'/>");
add_part(&the_rock_of_polynesia, "The dinghy crane", "<p>A thing that is unique to Niue, is that the island stands at 60m above sea level at its highest, 30m at its lowest. The pier wasn't nearly that tall, but it rose high enough to making getting onto it difficult. It had stairs carved on one side, to allow people like us to disembark, although these were slippery, and getting on with a running swell required much patience. Because of the constant wave action and current, its safer to hoist dinghies out of the water. A crane is set up on the pier to do just that. Even bigger boats make use of it. If fishermen want to fish, they need to truck their boats over to the pier, and they've got to lower it down into the water with the crane. When done, they've got to bring it back up the same way. No boat stays in the water.</p><img src='../media/blog/niue7.jpg'/><p>Iggy the dinghy made use of the crane too, and was parked up alongside a few others of its kind. Ours is often the smallest moored onto a pier, Niue was no exception, all the other dinghies were heavier and longer than our Iggy - none though, bore a name as cool.</p><p>Walking up to the island, we passed the station powering the crane, it was solar-powered. Going up further, we saw showers that were also solar-powered. Um, the rumours were true! Many other businesses were equipped with these wonderfully green devices.</p><p>Along the road we spotted a large gaping hole, as if someone had, 'a-la- minecraft', carved blocks out of it. The island is full of these limestone caves and chasms. Many a time, did we argue about the pronunciation of chasm. Ka-zim? Cha-zim?</p><img src='../media/blog/niue8.jpg'/>");
add_part(&the_rock_of_polynesia, "Alofi", "<p>The town of Alofi is on a road which circles the entire island, there are a few other smaller roads that criss-cross the land. We walked to the yacht club to to let them know we'd taken one of their moorings, a young new zealand girl was at the desk. The Commodore was on vacation, she explained, pointing to a guestbook on the desk for us to sign. The guestbook logged every yacht that came to Niue. Looking through, we smiled as we saw the names of boats we knew, now gone. We too left our mark in the log:</p><p><b>Pino</b> was here, July 2017.</p><p>The yacht club had an extensive library. We spent much time there, trying to dig up some new books to read. I found a comic by Elise Gravel, funny to find this all the way out here on a tiny island in the pacific. I then saw the name Murakami at the corner of my eye, but it was printed in Polish - damn. I spotted an old 70's vegetarian cooking book, filled with amazing and simple recipes, this one, found a home in our library. Devine was looking for penguin classics, any of them, also hoping to find the elusive 'letters from a stoic' from Seneca. No luck. We asked the stand-in Commodore if she'd been here long.</p><ul><li>'Not long no, it's hard to get a visa to stay here.'</li><li>'How come?'</li><li>'Niueans can live in New Zealand, but we can't live in Niue. Makes sense though, it's not a big island and it would change it completely if there were too many Kiwis around.'</li></ul><p>After <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Heta' target='_blank' class='external'>cyclone Heta</a> hit the island in 2004, many Niueans had their houses demolished and left. We saw this for ourselves when driving round to the south, skeletons of houses bordered the road, inhabited by ghosts and chickens.</p><img src='../media/blog/niue11.jpg'/><p>During a visit to Hio beach, we spoke to a Niuean who had just returned from living in New Zealand. She started a new business here on the island, a cafe built inside a red container.</p><ul><li>'Niueans are coming back, ' she said, 'it is our home, all we can do is return here.'</li></ul>");
add_part(&the_rock_of_polynesia, "Sea snakes", "<p>If you're ever on Niue, this cafe serves breadfruit chips, and the best - and cheapest - craft beer you'll find on the islands. Look for Kalaga-lager (try and say this 5 times in a row real fast), a beer made in New Zealand, but ironically, only available in Niue. The beer costs less than 1$ a can, many cruisers left the island with cases of it. If Pino could stand to carry more weight, we too, would have left with more.</p><img src='../media/blog/niue10.jpg'/><p>We walked out and continued the tour of our new neighborhood, although there was no one around. No one walking. Occasionally we'd see a car whizz by, once every 10 minutes. We walked past a small Indian restaurant, a place where we could buy data, a school, not much else. We didn't walk much further than this though, due to the presence of a stray pup who was very, very nippy. We turned around and spotted another stray, this one, not so nippy. We make a point of never touching animals we see on the street, this one was no exception, we walked past and headed over to a path leading down to a beach. The stray followed us there and eventually skipped ahead, it looked back to make sure we were still there.</p><img src='../media/blog/niue9.jpg'/><ul><li>'Maybe it's a trap.' Devine said.</li><li>'But it looks so friendly.' I said, weak to its doggy charms.</li><li>'Trick of the trade.'</li></ul><p>We wouldn't have followed this dog into a cave, but walking down some steps to a lovely beach front, we thought, would be safe enough. Besides, the dog had plans of its own, and began to chase something we couldn't see around the beach.</p><p>The beach had beautiful clear sand, and the water was shallow with a hard coral bottom. I put my feet in it, Devine did this too, but then pointed to a shape moving in the water.</p><ul><li>'Hey look a sea snake!'</li><li>'Oh wow! It's coming this way!'</li><li>'Do sea snakes bites?'</li><li>'I've no idea.'</li><li>'OH shit. It's swimming faster.'</li></ul><p>We darted back onto the sand, maybe it was very eager to say hello. We didn't stay to find out. I later read that some sea snakes are poisonous, and that a bite results in four weeks of excruciating pain, but not in death - pain, not death. Got it.</p><p>We had another encounter with a sea snake, in a place where it was king and us mere floating fleshies. We stood on Hio beach, and stared ahead at the long stretch of shallows we'd have to walk to get to the dive pools. A part of the shallows was soft sand, but most of it had an uneven texture that would make walking painful. Both of us, underprepared as always, were barefoot. We walked together, trying to prove to the other that this was nothing and that our feet weren't really being repeatedly penetrated by many sharp rocks.</p><p>The water barely covered my knees, then all of sudden, came a hole much deeper. We'd arrived at the pools. The pool had beautiful reef fish swimming in it, and was connected to others by tunnels or openings. We dove in, relieved to give our pained feet a break. The colors were unbelievable, we made a game of chasing each other through the different pools This is how we met the second sea snake. I saw it near me and made a detour to avoid it. Devine was behind me at the time but had not seen it, nor understood why I'd made that particular turn. At that moment too, the snake decided to swim out of its hiding spot. I saw Devine trying to get it to swim somewhere else, pushing walls of water at it with little success.</p><img src='../media/blog/niue12.jpg'/><p>We swam away, deciding to leave that particular pool to the sea snake. You win this round too, sea snake.");
add_part(&the_rock_of_polynesia, "Exploration", "<p>We visited many other sights on the island, it's amazing how many wondrous things there are to see here. We walked a stretch of land bearing thousands of spiked coral carved by wind and sea, leading to a drop, a deep crevasse, with a hidden forest of palms.</p><img src='../media/blog/niue14.jpg'/><p>We passed under giant arches of rock, around spires jutting out of the ground and into caves with walls so smooth they didn't feel real. We climbed down dark chasms, light in hand, and had a lunch of vegetable pitas in the dark next to a river of black liquid.</p><p>We swam in many other pools, in crystal clear waters, a mix of salt and fresh that made the surface water blurry.</p><p>Sometimes, as we walked in the caves, I would lose sight of Devine. Then moments later, Devine stood 10m above ground on a ledge in that same cave, grinning down at me.</p><ul><li>'How do you do that...!?'</li></ul><p>I was reminded of our time in Japan, when we climbed mount Fuji. Devine was always ahead, perched up on a ledge somewhere and waiting for me, always finding some high place to stand from, and doing so with ease.</p><img src='../media/blog/niue13.jpg'/><p>We don't get to visit islands so thoroughly usually, since neither of us can drive there are places we just can't go, that is, unless someone offers us a ride. This is how we visited Niue, a place with no public transportation and with a pier that makes it impossible to bring bikes ashore.</p><p>We have Leslie and Stu from S/Y Sula to thank for this trip, and for showing us how to open a coconut with a machete. We've since downgraded, cutting them open with a wood knife and a hammer, and I have to say, it's not nearly as cool as when Stu did it in the middle of the road with a long bit of dangerous-looking steel.</p><p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1_2X74iXo' target='_blank' class='external'>Watch a video</a> of our time in Niue.</p>");

Our plans for future ocean voyaging could have ended there though, because we almost crashed onto a reef.</p><p>Since we always time our arrival with the morning sun, I almost always get the first look of every island. Huahine stood in front of us, a series of volcanic peaks marked by deep valleys and blanketed in green, an island that came into being million of years ago.</p><p>We were heading for <a href='https://www.noforeignland.com/home/map/place/6560236114542592/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1558750803356' target='_blank' class='external'>Baie d'Avea</a>, to the south of the island.</p>");
add_part(&internet_in_paradise, "Near crash onto a reef", "<img src='../media/blog/huahine1.jpg'/><p>I'd picked this place, because we'd heard the internet was good - yes, we make decisions based on this a lot. I was worried though, because the bay appeared to be very open to swell. From accounts I'd read online, people said that it was a very protected harbor but looking at the anchorage on Navionics (a navigation app) I didn't believe it was protected. I thought we'd go and see for ourselves. I looked at images of the island online beforehand, but some important details had undoubtedly slipped my mind.</p><p>Whenever we near land we slow down and scan the horizon with our binoculars to get a look at the entrance. On Navionics, I did see that there was a dotted line around the island, but that's not how this app typically marks reefs or shallows on charts.</p><p>Something wasn't right.</p><p>Devine looked through the binoculars more carefully, trying to see the state of the water ahead between swells. The waves were curling and crashing onto something... onto a reef, and the water was getting shallower, and shallower.</p><ul><li>'It's a reef! Dead ahead!'</li></ul><p>Devine said, hurriedly.</p><p>We made a hard turn to port, running parallel to it. We had some distance between it and us – but it wasn't far.</p><p>Evidently, there was no pass to Baie d'Avea on the south west side of the island.</p><p>Why did this happen? We had sonar on. In this view, the reef is not marked by a big patch of shallow blues or greens, but by a thin dotted line. I assumed that the light blue patch was a reef, but the lighter white part west of the channel markers was indicative of a pass. In the image below on the left, is the sonarchart (that we had on at the time), and the other is the regular chart view. Usually, sonar offers more precision in maps and it's why we use it. We've learned our lesson. In hindsight, we should have read more about the island rather than to rely completely on our nav app, especially after reading <a href='http://svcrystalblues.blogspot.com/2017/09/navionics-sonar-charts-missing-reef.html' target='_blank' class='external'>this article</a> by another boat reporting the same problem with sonar charts.</p><img src='../media/blog/huahine12.jpg'/><p>Devine and I couldn't believe it. We were shocked, but glad that we always plan our entrances in the full light of day, and that we trusted our ears and eyes more than the app. We learned later that <a href='https://adventuresofatribe.com/2017/07/23/mayday/' target='_blank' class='external'>many boats crash onto this reef</a>, happy to say that <a href='https://www.noforeignland.com/home/boat/4733784360484864/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1557534132049' target='_blank' class='external'>Pino</a> was not one of them. There were boats anchored in the bay, we wondered then if they'd seen us pointing toward the reef hoping Huahine wouldn't claim another yacht.</p><p>I looked at the chart again - making sure sonar was off this time - to try and see how we could go to Baie D'Avea, without having to jump a reef to get to it. There was one pass, at the very north end of the island.</p><ul><li>'It's one hour to the pass, then another hour to get to the bay. Still want to go?'</li></ul><p>I asked.</p><ul><li>'For internet, yes.'</li></ul><p>The things we do for internet.</p>");
add_part(&internet_in_paradise, "Avea Bay", "<p>To go to Avea Bay, we had to sail north to get in through the pass, then sail down to the south from inside the reef.</p><p>Arriving into the north, we could see the small village of <b>Fare</b>, this is where we would have to go to get groceries. The village bordered the water, a large concrete pier covered the downtown side, a big ship was tied to it with people busy lifting cargo from its deck. This part of the island was relatively flat, lacking in peaks. We moved past it, and began to motor southward toward our anchorage.</p><img src='../media/blog/huahine8.jpg'/><p>The pass was long and winding, often shallow, I'd stand at the bow to look at the passing bommies below. The land was hilly and lush. A small road ran along the water, we could see cars coming in and out of view, few cars – this island was small. Some of the shore was lined with rows of pillared-huts, a resort for tourists consisting of little bungalows with thatched roofs.</p><p>We arrived a short hour later into Baie d'Avea, there were few boats here. The bay had moorings. These we'd read, were free. In fact, all moorings on the island were free for anyone to take. We dropped our anchor in 10m of water, right within range of the hotel wifi - perfect.</p><p>We put Iggy in the water and went over to a pier in front of the hotel. As we neared it, the sea floor rose beneath us and with it blocks of coral and anemones. The water had a healthy population of fish.</p><img src='../media/blog/huahine10.jpg'/><p>The famous clown fish remained in the safety of the anemones. Picasso triggerfish hovered near, their faces intricately painted. The yellow moorish idols poked at the coral and sponges with their tubular noses, their head spines dramatically elongated to form a trailing sickle-shaped crest. We couldn't wait to get into the water, to go and see them all up close!</p><p>The pier looked new, beautifully constructed, a higher part acted as a walk-way to a scenic viewpoint for tourists. A set of stairs lead to a lower part of the pier, where boats could moor their dinghies. At times, this part of the pier was near-submerged. It had shiny new cleats, and the wood was immaculate.</p><img src='../media/blog/huahine2.jpg'/><p>We tied Iggy to the low pier and stepped ashore, this pier belongs to the hotel but unlike some other places we were not asked to pay them a fee to tie to it. Another great thing about it, was the presence of a fresh-water shower on the shore annexed to the pier so beach-goers could rinse the salt and sand off after a swim. We made use of it, keeping the fresh water from our tanks for drinking and dishes instead.</p><p>Baie d'Avea, and the whole of Huahine isn't completely overrun by tourists. Despite the presence of a resort, the place remains low-key. The resort doesn't claim ownership of the beach front, the locals, yachties and tourists can all come and make use of the pier, the showers and the sandy beach.</p><p>We found the password to the wifi with ease, they made no attempt to conceal it and didn't seem to care if we were guests of the hotel or not.</p><img src='../media/blog/huahine9.jpg'/>");
add_part(&internet_in_paradise, "Internet", "<p>For the rest of the month, we had wifi from the boat - what a nice change! Everywhere else we'd been so far, we had to take our laptops ashore to get a signal, and this often meant meant having to pay to sit in a bar, or cafe to upload a video, send out a few tweets or download an important file. We don't mind paying for a drink, but if we need to upload a video we have to be there for hours at a time, with no way to charge our laptops. Restaurants, bars and care rarely provide this service, and will often refuse use of their outlets. Uploading anything then becomes a 3-day endeavour, sitting outside, while mosquitoes make a meal of our flesh.</p><p>Now, we get to stay on Pino to do these tasks, and we can spend our visits ashore taking walks and swimming rather than turning it into computer time. On occasion though, as the wind shifts to the south, Pino would get pushed just out of wifi range. We laughed at this, checking the weather for the next day to see if we could have wifi on the boat or not.</p><p>Our wifi is wind dependent.</p><p>WOOSH! Pino swings to the south. 5 bars.</p><p>WOOSH! Pino swings back to the north. 2 bars – damn!</p><p>I was able to update my ipad, to get an app that would permit me to use it as a drawing station. We also uploaded videos to our channel - yep, the connection was that good!</p><img src='../media/blog/huahine3.jpg'/>");
add_part(&internet_in_paradise, "The best anchorage in Polynesia", "<p>Internet aside, this turned out to be our favorite anchorage in Polynesia. The water was clear and calm, there was little noise or traffic. We spent a lot of time in the water, floating on the surface and facing down, looking at the stingrays gliding in the depths. They moved effortlessly, their pectoral fins undulating and propelling them forward.</p><p>Everytime we thought we saw a turtle, we'd scream it aloud so the other would hear.</p><ul><li>'TURTLE!'</li></ul><p>It was almost never a turtle.</p><p>Turtle heads poking out of the water resemble coconut shells. We're confident though, that at least one of those coconut shells was a turtle, coconut shells typically don't submerge at will.</p><img src='../media/blog/huahine6.jpg'/><p>Devine & I were never that comfortable swimming around the boat before. We did fine in pools, but otherwise diving into a big space full of living creatures was a frightening experience. Bit by bit, I swam further, and Devine deeper. We became creatures of the ocean.</p><p>Fish arent as frightful as land creatures, its crazy how close you can get without them making any effort to avoid you. Walking into a forest, you're lucky if you can spot anything at all, but in the water very few hide, most will swim close or near you.</p><img src='../media/blog/huahine5.jpg'/><p>We took Iggy out to the outer reef once in a while. There wasn't much on the sea floor, just small blocks of coral, and a lot of darkly-tinted sea cucumbers. An infinity of leathery sea pickles, a horrid mine field of sunken turds - not very appealing. When you think of the south pacific, this isn't the image that comes to mind.</p><p>Going ashore didn't offer much in terms of sight-seeing, aside from the resort, there was not much else around. A 30 min walk away, was a tiny shop that sold canned goods, mostly canned fish and corned beef. They had some dry snacks, a limited set of toiletries and no fresh foods, aside from some sad, sad onions. Some days they said they had potatoes and greens, but we never saw any on the shelves. The road-side to the shop was full of coconut trees, the shells lining the road.</p><p>The small shops never had much, that is, unless we walked in with the goal of buying an endless supply of corned beef. If we wanted to get more fresh foods, we'd have to take the boat back up to Fare in the north of the island. We took Pino back there once, only to re-supply, and hurried right back down to Baie d'Avea. It's so much nicer there, there's always room to anchor and it's calm - so, so, calm.</p>");
add_part(&internet_in_paradise, "The town of Fare", "<p>Fare is one of the nicer French Polynesian villages we've visited, the U supermarket has a good supply of everything. Although, it's important to always check inside packaging when buying dried goods. One day, Devine bought a bag of rice kept in a thick paper bag, when we opened it that same day we saw it had an entire eco system living in it, an advanced civilization of moths. The same happened when buying dried pasta in plastic bags, sometimes we'd find things living in it. A lot of times, the bugs didn't enter the bag after, but came with it in the form of eggs. A warm environment makes it real easy for these eggs to hatch, it is virtually impossible to completely remove all traces of insects from raw agricultural grain foods, which is how the weevils (or their eggs) got there in the first place.</p><img src='../media/blog/huahine7.jpg'/><p>The idea is to either eat it all before the eggs hatch, or to freeze or heat the grains prior to storing them to kill the eggs. Being lazy, and lacking a fridge, we don't do these things, we just pick our packaging carefully, avoiding paper and cardboard and opting for thick plastic whenever possible. If the bugs are already in the grain, there is little that can be done. While we would prefer to avoid plastic, in the tropics not having plastic means your food will likely be infested with bugs. We had this happen many times: opening a box of couscous, only to find a moth flying out of it, or cutting open a bulb of garlic, again, to find hatchlings hiding in there. We've had our share of insect troubles. I spent many evenings sifting creepy-crawlies out of rice, or flour, with a bowl and strainer. In a place were food is costly, and scarce, we let go of our disdain of such things. If only our past selves could see us now.</p><ul><li>'So future Rekka, what did you last night?''</li><li>'Oh you know - same old, same old. Sifted bugs out of my rice for 3 hours.'</li></ul><p>The smile on past Rekka's face disappears.</p><ul><li>ಠ╭╮ಠ</li></ul><p>Still think we're living the dream?</p><p>You have the weigh the good against the bad, insects in food sucks, because I like food and prefer it bug-free, but being able to swim with angel fish, trumpet fish and octopus is very, very good.</p><p>We could have lost our home to a reef, not many can say this or imagine what that's like. You can take your home anywhere with you, and that's amazing, but it means getting it through difficult places. There is always a risk involved. A beautiful risk.</p><img src='../media/blog/huahine11.jpg'/><p>This is where we spent our last month in French polynesia, admiring with child-like fascination every living thing around us, every bird and fish, etched into our minds.</p><p>Yes, yes – even the disgusting sea cucumbers.</p><p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-vJEu_uL8Y' target='_blank' class='external'>Watch a video</a> of our time in <b>Huahine</b>.</p>");

add_part(&rainy_with_a_chance_of_mosquitoes, "Nuku hiva in french polynesia", "<p><b>Nuku Hiva</b>, a green mountainous island in the Pacific, straight out of Jurassic Park. Just as foreign and just as wild, except instead of hungry lizards there are mosquitoes, also known as the vampires of the Marquesas.</p><p>Before arriving, we didn't know what it was going to be like there, we'd barely read anything about it. We knew where we'd anchor, that people there spoke french and that there would be tropical fruit, but beyond that it was a blur, a black spot in our minds. We read the book <b>Fourteen</b> during our 28-day transit from La Paz. In this book, the family sailed to Nuku Hiva, but their experience there was not so good. It wasn't bad because of the Marquesans, or the island itself, but because of no-no's, little biting bugs that hide in sand. We took a mental note of this: \"Avoid sand beaches, and you will have a great time!\"</p><p>On day 27 of our voyage, I could see the outline of the island in the distance. I stood at the bow, trying to take footage of the event, but was disappointed with the shot. Far-away wonders have a way of looking unimpressive on camera. I was about to put the camera away, when I heard a 'wooshing' sound. I looked over the side, and saw an orca whale swimming next to Pino, its length matching our own. It stayed with us for a long while, it's white belly making it easy to spot it in the water. This unusual encounter was a great start to our Marquesian adventure.</p><p><a href='https://www.noforeignland.com/home/boat/4733784360484864/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1557534132049' target='_blank' class='external'>Pino</a> arrived at the entrance to <a href='https://www.noforeignland.com/home/map/place/5690458764214272/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1558533207558' target='_blank' class='external'>Taiohae bay</a>. I sat on the bow with Iggy's deflated corpse. I pumped life back into it, while it, sucked mine out. I was sweaty, a constant stream of body water oozing down my back. We had no dinghy pump, having broken it ages ago. All we had was a jury-rigged contraption using a bike pump, a bike tube and the hose from the old pump. It worked, but it took twice as long to put air into anything.</p><p>A super yacht was anchored in the mouth of the bay, called 'Ethereal'. \"How fitting\", I thought.</p><p>It's as if the yacht was a sign, a warning of the view to come — one, that was definitely ethereal.</p><p>A chain of mountains, green and fuzzy, and ahead a bay filled with boats flying flags from all over the world. We found a spot in 12 m of water, mud bottom, and dropped anchor. The sky was clear, but clouds clung to the peaks of every mountain. It was a rare thing, we realized afterwards, for the skies to be clear. Most days were grey. While grey often means rain, it also means less sun. It was over 30 degrees every day, so hot that at times we couldn't work, our bodies shiny with sweat, driving us mad. Mad to the point that we seriously considered flooding the cockpit with water to turn it into a pool.</p>");
add_part(&rainy_with_a_chance_of_mosquitoes, "Our routine", "<img src='../media/blog/nukuhiva13.jpg'/><p>Everyday, we'd get up with the sun. The mornings were cooler, but around 10am, when it was too warm in the boat we went ashore to work from the snack bar. This place was an open-air restaurant with seating outside, the kitcken was in a tiny building with a counter. There were with many tables, occupied by locals but most of all, by boaters. There was free internet there, but getting something to drink or to eat was encouraged. We would always get the same thing, a freshly squeezed glass of pamplemousse juice. Pamplemousse is nothing like the grapefruit we had in Canada, they're 3 times as big, green inside and out, and sweet-tasting. The seating area was covered with a plastic canopy, euro-style outlets hung on every post, sharing the space with stalks of bananas.</p><img src='../media/blog/nukuhiva11.jpg'/><p>Many animals stayed around the snack bar, dogs lay under the tables, hiding from the sun, but these did little to shield them from the constant onslaught of flies. There were also chickens, lot of chickens and roosters. I thought roosters only crowed in the morning, but no, they crow for no reason, at all hours of the day, a series of endless b'gawking and cluck-clucking. We'd also seen horses walk around, but they didn't care to hang around the pier and much preferred nibbling on bits of tall grass further inland.</p><p>We sat at the Snack everyday, catching a bit of internet before everyone else would come ashore to use it. Uploading anything was a challenge. We found an internet lounge in the village, a small building with walls covered in popular (but old) xbox and playstation titles. There were tables with old computers, televisions and consoles. Kids sat playing games, while 3 giant fans helped cool the place down. The owner was friendly, we got along well enough, so much that he let us leave our laptop there overnight to get a big file online. It took 3 days to upload a 10 minute video, and this is with, apparently, the fastest internet on the island. Many locals would come to the internet place to ask for movies, or series. Even all the way out here, people kept up game of thrones, the walking dead, or other popular media.</p><img src='../media/blog/nukuhiva2.jpg'/><p>Even if it was really hot, we didn't swim here. It rained everyday, and the run-off from the mountain made the water brown and unclear. It wasn't inviting. And not just this, the first time we took the dinghy ashore, we noticed a lot of splish-splashing in the water near the concrete pier, then our eyes moved to someone, tossing pink wet slabs into the water.</p><p>Then, I saw fins.</p><p>Fins and tails, and mouths with teeth!</p><p>Sharks. Many sharks.</p><p>While I thought them wonderful, my monkey brain still feared teeth.</p><p>Devine and I gulped. We cared little to swim after that, even after seeing kids leaping off that same pier for a swim a few hours later. These kids were fearless. They made a game of it, just like they made a game of swimming where the waves break on the shore. The island had no reef, so when the tide and wind-driven waves came in, the water would race to shore, unhindered, and explode onto the sea wall with a loud CLAP! There was no beach there, at low-tide the bottom was just mud and rocks, mostly rocks, polished after years of sea caresses. The waves hitting the wall were big, but even so, the kids took to the sea! They grabbed street signs, bits of wood, whatever they could find that resembled a body-board, then they'd sit in the water, and wait for the waves to come. The waves always did come, and buried them all in an instant. The kids laughed. They'd played this game a hundred times.</p><p>We were impressed, and felt we'd led very sheltered lives.</p><img src='../media/blog/nukuhiva12.jpg'/>");
add_part(&rainy_with_a_chance_of_mosquitoes, "Polynesian languages", "<p>The people in Nuku Hiva were exceptionally nice to us. Because we could speak french, we had an edge. It was easier to befriend locals.</p><p>While the locals spoke French, they also spoke Marquesan, a language of many vowels. When we first saw it written down, we remembered a song in 'national lampoon's christmas vacation', the scene when Clark imagines a woman on a diveboard, about to dive into his imaginary pool. A song is playing in the background, it goes: 'Mele kalikimaka.'</p><p>It was very similar to the writing I'd seen in the village. I wondered then, is Hawaiian that different from Marquesan? After much reading, I found that both fall under <b>central eastern polynesian</b>, which is sub-divided into <b>Marquesic</b> — encompassing Marquesan AND Hawaiian — and <b>Tahitic</b>. All Polynesian languages show strong similarity, particularly in vocabulary. 'Mele kalikimaka' is Hawaiian, and means 'merry christmas', or at least that's what the song says it means. I learned then, that the only central eastern polynesian words I knew were actually the Hawaiian equivalent of katakana in Japanese. The polynesians had no notion of religion or christmas, that is, until the missionaries arrived. Because the word didn't exist, Hawaiians opted for a phonetic translation of merry christmas instead of making a new word for it.</p><p>But now, I was down to knowing no Polynesian at all, Hawaiian or Marquesan, but that changed quickly enough. When walking down the street, people smiled at us and said:</p><ul><li>'La Orana!'</li></ul><p>Which we promptly repeated, and which means 'Hello!'. This word is similar in all central eastern polynesian countries:</p><p>French polynesia - La orana! (yo-rah-nah)</p><p>Cook islands - Kia orana!</p><p>New Zealand - Kia ora!</p><p>We did mix these up on occasion, we always counted on the fact that they'd assumed we said the correct thing. In doubt, you could say the words quickly, under your breath. No one would know. Or if they did, they were too damn polite to say anything about it. Bless them.</p>");
add_part(&rainy_with_a_chance_of_mosquitoes, "Tattoos", "<p>Marquesans were really keen on tattoos, a lot of people had them, and were very pleased to see ours! A lot of foreigners would come here to get tattoos, including an old salt we met, the captain of a 70-foot steel boat. If you asked him about tattoos, he would tell you, in a broken English accent, that he cared little for them. Don't ask me how, but he ended up with some ink on his shoulder, even then, he wasn't too fond of my black-out tattoo.</p><ul><li>'What does it mean?'</li></ul><p>He asked me one day.</p><ul><li>'It has no meaning, it's purely aesthetic,'</li></ul><p>Then, after realizing that I'd reached the limit of his English, I simplified.</p><ul><li>'It means nothing, I just like it.'</li></ul><p>He spoke good enough french, but whenever I tried to talk to him his eyes went real small, as if doing this would sharpen his hearing. I always spoke to him in french first, but I'd switch to English afterwards – it's entirely possible that my accent was just too pronounced. He always did understand me in the end. The answer I gave him, about the meaning of my tattoo, in simple English, displeased him, and he began to lecture me on how silly it was to bear something permanent on your person that had no meaning. People love to lecture me about this, and I love to ignore them.</p><img src='../media/blog/nukuhiva14.jpg'/>");
add_part(&rainy_with_a_chance_of_mosquitoes, "Fruits and vegetables", "<p>In the afternoon, after spending the first part of the day at the Snack, we went on walks around the island. The place had fruit trees at every corner, bearing mangos, papayas, sugar apples, coconut, pamplemousse, passion fruit and breadfruit. All of the houses were camouflaged in green, there was plenty to eat on their property. It is why in some places it was hard to find fruit, stores just don't sell them because the locals have no need of them. There was a market near the concrete pier that sold fruit, frequented by those who came on boats, planes or cruiseships. The market sold fresh vegetables too, brought by cargo ships every week. On days when the cargo ships arrived, the stands were full of fresh produce, many of them in high demand and of short supply. If you wanted tomatoes, you had to get up early at 5am to get them. We didn't care to do that. We bought local fruit instead, fresh papaya makes a good substitute for tomatoes in <a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/papaya_bruschetta_topping.html' target='_blank'>bruschetta</a>. Our staples were eggplant, sweet potato, daikon radish and cabbage.</p><img src='../media/blog/nukuhiva15.jpg'/><p>We soon adopted the local produce too, like <a href='http://grimgrains.com/site/breadfruit.html' target='_blank'>breadfruit</a>, there is so much to say about this humble plant. It is a species of the jackfruit family, it has a potato-like flavour, but the more ripe it is the sweeter the taste. <a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/breadfruit.html' target='_blank'>Breadfruit</a> is a good medium, and can be made into a number of things, we experimented a lot with this during our stay in the islands. Many of the locals looked at us funny when we asked to buy them.</p><ul><li>'Breadfruit? That's what my grandparents eat.'</li></ul><p>Not so cool with the youngsters apparently.</p>");
add_part(&rainy_with_a_chance_of_mosquitoes, "Dengue fever", "<p>During our walks on the island, we almost always regretted walking so far because of how warm it was. The deeper you walk, the more humid, and the less wind there is, and the more you ooze. A walk to the hardware store, or to the pharmacy, always resulted in us coming back looking like we'd gone for a swim.</p><p>It's during one of these walks, that Devine contracted dengue fever. Devine had bad headaches and muscle pains, sleeping was difficult and moving was near impossible at times. We'd read about dengue and knew what it was, plus the symptoms matched up, but we weren't sure and it worried us, and so Devine went to the hospital to get a second opinion. On return, a 300$ bill to be paid in hand, Devine appeared confused.</p><ul><li>'They didn't say I had dengue, but made me take scans, thinking the pains I had were maybe due to scoliosis.'</li><li>'What? That makes NO sense.'</li><li>'No. It really doesn't.'</li></ul><p>Devine did have dengue, but the hospital didn't want to diagnose anyone with it. The reason for that was simple, if there is a certain number of reports, they have to declare an epidemic, which can in turn, scare all of the visitors away. Dengue is bad for business, and the polynesians depend on tourism. I understand this, Devine was healthy otherwise and in no real risk, but did wish they hadn't billed us 300$ to cover up the lie.</p><img src='../media/blog/nukuhiva16.jpg'/><p>Everyone in the bay knows when a cruiseship is coming, because the locals make a show of it, dressing in traditional wear and playing music. The cruiseships, the blue whale equivalent of Pino, ferry people back and forth in vessels that resemble little space shuttles, they do this all day, to and fro, morning till evening. The tourists look like tourists, pale, camera or ipad in hand, they'd buy their souvenirs, something authentic, take tours around the island and then return to their ocean castle.</p><p>Going to work at the Snack was a bad idea with a cruiseship around, it was crowded with tourists, all trying to skype to their family, a continent or two away, while in the background, chickens comically clucked and b'gawked extra harder – I suspected they knew what they were doing.</p><p>Devine did recover from dengue, but days later spotted a good friend who suffered the same. The hospital said the same thing, about it not being dengue, minus the warning about it possibly being scoliosis.</p><p>We stayed in Nuku Hiva for a long while, which permitted us to start and complete the production of our book <a href='https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/thousand-rooms' target='_blank' class='external'>Thousand rooms</a>. It wasn't easy to work on this here, we seriously overerestimated our tolerance to warm weather, but we got it done still! Our open-air office, Snack Vaeki, wasn't such a bad place to work from after all, we had unlimited pamplemousse juice and the company of other sailors.</p>");
add_part(&rainy_with_a_chance_of_mosquitoes, "Diesel run", "<p>By the end of the month, we were getting restless, and decided to move to the next bay. Before doing that, we had to get some diesel. Getting diesel was not the easiest, we took our dinghy to another concrete pier at low tide (due to poor planning). Concrete piers don't float up and down but stay right where they are, to our great displeasure, we had a 6-foot ladder to climb to get onto it. I brought a rope, figured we could lower the jerry cans down into the dinghy that way. First, we got all 4 cans up, and tied Iggy to a step in the ladder. We had them filled up at the gas station, just a short walk away.</p><p>I stood on the pier while Devine was in the dinghy below, I tied a rope to the handle of the first jerry can and lowered it, while Devine was trying to keep Iggy steady in the waves. We dropped none, operation diesel-pickup was a success.</p><img src='../media/blog/nukuhiva6.jpg'/>");
add_part(&rainy_with_a_chance_of_mosquitoes, "Daniels Bay", "<p>We also had to fill our water, <a href='https://www.noforeignland.com/home/map/place/5083436372983808/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1558533871977' target='_blank' class='external'>Daniel's bay</a> was just a short sail away and was the best place to do it. The anchorage was beautiful, smaller, with high cliffs on one side, if you looked carefully you could see goats walking on its ridges, we could hear them too, bleating in succession. We asked our neighbor, a german sailor, where to get water. He smiled, and told us that he was going there now.</p><ul><li>'You'll have to follow me very closely, many rocks in the entrance, and current, and waves. Do like me, and you'll be okay.'</li></ul><p>We followed him into the mouth of the river. There was a lot of current and swell, and the water was shallow, if we weren't careful we'd end up on the rocks for sure. The german guy was ahead of us, proceeding slowly, every now and then he pulled up his outboard, avoiding rocks no doubt. We mirrored his movements.</p><ul><li>'Do like him, yes. He knows. He must know!'</li></ul><img src='../media/blog/nukuhiva7.jpg'/><p>We said to ourselves, nervously, all the while wondering how it is he knew where the rocks were. The water wasn't any clearer here. We preferred not to dwell on this, not because it made us nervous, but because we had to focus on what was happening now. We went past the ugly bit of the river, and arrived into the calm bit, relieved. The river was long and narrow, bordered by many trees, it felt like being on the Amazon. Not that I've been on the Amazon, say, it's my mind's memory of a film about what it was like to be on the Amazon.</p><img src='../media/blog/nukuhiva8.jpg'/><p>The german guy arrived near a grassy shore, and tied the dinghy to a tree. We did the same.</p><ul><li>'Watch your head you two, you die if you get hit in the head by a falling coconut.'</li></ul><p>We looked up at the top of the tree we had moored onto, and there was, indeed, a lot of them up there, waiting to kill us perhaps, we thought, or maybe they just didn't feel like it today.</p><p>There was a tap nearby, just a pipe sticking out of the ground with a faucet at the end of it. It didn't belong there at all. It looked like an anomaly, a glitch in the matrix.</p><ul><li>'Water is very clean, very good. Best water in french polynesia!'</li></ul><p>The german guy said. Soon, a Marquesan named Paul joined us, a jolly and friendly-looking fellow. Our guide and he knew each other, in fact, the german guy gave him a hinano beer, which they cracked opened in front of us. Paul explained that the water came from the mountain, and as the german guy had said, many times already, it was very good and very clean.</p><ul><li>'You sell fruit here?' We then asked.</li><li>'Yes, yes! Oh! I like your tattoos! Come, I'll introduce you to my uncle, he likes tattoos too!'</li></ul><img src='../media/blog/nukuhiva.10.jpg'/><p>He also said he'd take us to pick some fruit, all from trees on his property, which was the queen's land – or something along those lines. We walked up to an old house, with skulls attached to the wood beams, and other trinkets hanging about. ");
add_part(&rainy_with_a_chance_of_mosquitoes, "Hello Uncle", "This was his uncle's house. The first thing we saw upon entering, was a kitten on a leash.</p><ul><li>'Uncle?'</li></ul><p>But Uncle turned out to be human after all – how boring.</p><p>Paul appeared older than Uncle, we wondered then if we'd misunderstood something, we never did find out. Uncle had long black hair, tied into a high bun, and of course, he had tattoos. He shook our hand, but didn't say much, in fact, the cat had meowed more than he'd spoken.</p><img src='../media/blog/nukuhiva9.jpg'/><p>Now both began to walk around the property, picking fruits for us. Uncle climbed up a tree, while Paul used a long stick to pick off mangos. In the end, we had about 10 pamplemousses, 2 papayas, 6 mangos, 3 soursops and 1 giant stalk of bananas. I looked at the stalk of bananas, trying to imagine how many banana breads I'd have to make once they'd all decide to ripen at the same time, because that's what bananas do, they synchronize, they enjoy the look of terror on our faces as their skin gets spottier, and darker with every passing day.</p><p>Iggy was very full then, with much water and fruit, we were ready for our transit to the Tuamotus. We had to ride in the ugly part of the river again to get to Pino, without our german guide this time. We managed well enough, our eyes widening with every coming swell. What a shame it would be, if all of these fruits fell into the deep.</p><p>Our time in Nuku Hiva was at an end, but other islands and challenges lay ahead.</p><p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raCuLpJRqTY' target='_blank' class='external'>Watch a video</a> of our time in <b>Nuku Hiva</b>.</p>");

add_part(&off_the_grid, "why live off grid", "<img src='../media/content/knowledge/rain.jpg'/><p>People choose to live off-grid for self-sufficience, resilience, or ecological reasons. For us, to live off-grid, is most of all letting go of the numbing culture of convenience. When anchored in a foreign country, far from everything and everyone, you depend on your own self, your vessel and what's on it. When something breaks, it falls onto you to fix it. Electricity becomes a finite resource, limited to the amount of solar panels on deck, and to the size of your battery bank.</p><p>This way of life is not necessarily restrictive, you might find that learning to live in communion with your vessel offers a peace of mind previously unimaginable.</p><p>Maslow's pyramid of needs positions as most basic, or most crucial, physiological needs, like water, food, warmth and rest, followed closely with security and safety. Meeting these basic needs, while living aboard a sailboat, takes but some planning and time.</p><img src='../media/content/knowledge/bow.jpg'/><p>Aiming to reduce our footprint, by learning to live according to the sun and the wind has been an excellent exercise toward mindfulness, something we much needed to better navigate today's attention economy.</p>");
add_part(&off_the_grid, "water", "<p>It's easy to forget that water is not inexhaustible when it flows so readily by the turn of the tap. Living on a boat, you develop a deeper connection to this precious resource. Depending on where you go, you'll have to treat it, catch it, carry it or pay for it.</p><p>Basic needs are covered with a mere 10 liters of water a day per person. A person needs between 2.7 and 3.7 liters of drinking water each day. When anchored near a port, once a week, we would ferry four bins of 10 liters from shore to the boat. To conserve water, our sink faucet is operated with a foot pump, where each push draws out 60 ml of water, allowing us to measure our usage.</p><p>On passages, we carry extra Jerrycans of water, enough to sustain two people for a few more weeks than the length of our trip. Having separate bins makes for a more resilient system, if salt gets into one tank, it won't corrupt the entirety of your supplies. A sure way of preventing contamination, is to check all o-rings and tanks for leaks before leaving. We chose not to have a desalinator aboard Pino, and have managed well without it. It's a device that is expensive, high maintenance and power-hungry.</p>");
add_part(&off_the_grid, "rain catchment", "<p>Rain catchment is a good way to top-up your tanks. Some sailors set up tarps to catch and lead the water into Jerrycans, others have the water flow directly into their main tank — I don't recommend doing that unless you've got a good filtration system. When it rained, we'd collect water trickling down from our aft solar panels into a 20 liter bucket. We collected this extra water for showers, laundry and washing dishes.</p><p>While the rain itself might be safe to drink, it carries dirt or whatever may be on your tarp, or deck. And depending on where you are, the rain may have environmental pollutants mixed in. For these reasons, I recommend using rainwater for purposes other than drinking and cooking. If you are to drink it, it's important to boil it first for at least 1 minute, or to run it through a good two-step filtration system.</p><p>Even if you don't plan on drinking it, it's a good idea to treat the water you catch. The easiest way to do this is to add chlorine bleach to your supply. This is something we've done, and continue to do. The suggested ratio of chlorine to water is 2 drops bleach for 1.15 liters (1 quart). The above ratios are for bleach containing 5.25% Sodium Hypochlorite. This amount depends on the concentration, the ratios will be different for 5.25% than for 8% chlorine bleach (1 drop: 1.15 l). Only use regular, unscented chlorine bleach products that are suitable for disinfection and sanitization, as indicated on the label. A good way to remember these ratios, is this saying:</p><p>“You must be 21 to drink”.</p><p>2 drops bleach per 1 liter (quart) water, easy to remember. Note that 1 quart is slightly less than 1 liter.</p>");
add_part(&off_the_grid, "showers", "<p>Coastal locations like marinas and public beaches often have fresh water showers for local swimmers or marina guests. Usually free, or available for use at a nominal fee (1-2$ for 5 minutes).</p><p>We use a pressurized sprayer as a shower, it uses little water and can be found in most hardware stores.

Adding up the wattage gave us a rough estimate of our daily use.</p><p>Of course, the energy coming from solar panels fluctuate based on the angle of the sun, the cloud coverage and other obstructions. Our own power usage aboard can also vary a lot from day to day, depending on what we choose to do that day. While on passages, our capability to capture sunlight is reduced to keep our windage low, but our energy consumption is equally reduced for not much else is drawing power than our navigation electronics like the AIS, the wind meter, and at night, the lights.</p><p>An anchored board will orbit its anchor according to the wind, and rarely stays in the same spot and so it is difficult to position panels to guarantee an optimal draw. We've had many cloudless days with the mast casting a shadow covering a large part of our panels. On moments such as this, or cloudy days, we adapt by using our appliances less. We live according to the weather.</p><p>Instead of scaling our battery banks to our needs, we chose to adapt our needs to the available space for batteries and surface for panels. It's also important to consider that more solar panels often mean more windage.Having a complex system exposed to a harsh environment like the sea, creates opportunities for things to break. Saltwater corrosion is a very real threat. Nowadays, many electronics, or 'smart' systems, use proprietary parts, making them difficult to repair. We've encountered many boats, stuck in port for weeks and weeks, waiting for parts to arrive. An over-reliance on convenience products may bind you to services on land, in a way that you may not want.</p><p>Aboard Pino, we carry a small portable generator as a backup to our solar. Our Honda’s 1,000-watt generator is compact, fuel-efficient, lightweight, and can run for 7.1 hours on 2.7 liters (0.6 gal) of gas.

Keeping surrounding waters clean and free of contaminants is important. The primary environmental concern with sewage is not the urine, which is sterile, but feces which contain bacteria, pathogens, and nutrients, and should not go overboard. The septic tank may only be emptied, from at least, 3 miles from shore.</p><p>Pump-out stations will help you get rid of waste, but are only available near a handful of cities. Composting toilets might be a good option for those who do not want to haul anchor and head offshore to flush their tank. Having a composting head aboard frees up much-needed space. It also means no holding tank to empty, no smelly hoses to unclog, and little to no maintenance. You can build your own composting head or buy one of the many models on the market.</p><p>Most models have a urine diverter, separating the liquids from the solids to ensure contamination-free composting. Some models also have fans, to help the solids dry out and remove odors. In composting heads, urine accounts for ~85% of the waste volume in tanks. Having a diverter is great because it increases capacity for solids, which means not having to empty the tank as often. The ideal medium for processing your waste into compost depends on how you plan on using your toilet and vary between sawdust or peat moss. C-head wrote <a href='https://www.c-head.com/post/coco-coir-peat-moss-which-medium' target='_blank'>a very good article</a> on the subject.</p><p>Disposing of the waste requires a bit of planning. If near a city, partnering with someone on land with composting facilities is ideal, but otherwise, bringing the solids to the trash in composting bags is the next best thing. When full, it's possible to empty jugs of urine into public toilets. If there are no facilities nearby, capping it off to dispose of later, and replacing the jug is a good option. </p>");

For iodine, carry iodized salt, or seaweed (wakame or nori). Other essentials, like omega 6 (LA, linoleic acid), can be found in pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds for instance, omega 3 (ALA, alpha-linoleic acid) can be found in linseed and chia seeds (about 1 tbsp a day).</p><p>Staples like nut milks and oats are found everywhere, varying in price and quality. There will always be fresh vegetables available, but the selection can be poor at times. Carrying cans and and dried version of those foods can help, for example: canned and dried potatoes. Canned spinach may not be appealing, but in a place where there are no leafy greens available, it's better than not having any at all. Canned is not ideal, because it has a lot of added ingredients like salt and sugar, but if you plan in advance you can buy brands that have little additives.</p><p>Eating frozen, can help in a bind, a lot of frozen vegetables don't lose their nutrients, like Brocoli for instance. Most places will carry frozen goods, and it's generally cheaper than buying the same item fresh.

Items like peppers and leafy greens will spoil quickly, and should be eaten first. Store the fresh produce in a shaded, ventilated space. Potatoes and onions belong in a cool, dark place such as a vegetable basket, ideally in a cloth bag. Store them separately. Buy tomatoes in varying stages of ripeness to greenness, by buying in various stages your supply will last longer.</p><p>Leftovers we eat the next day, incorporating it into other meals to offer some variety.

add_part(&buying_a_sailboat, "what boat to buy", "<p>When we began looking for a sailboat to buy, we'd spend evenings browsing listings on yachtworld, trying to figure out what sort of vessel best suited our needs and budget. Next are questions to ask yourself to help narrow your search:</p><p>1. <b>Budget</b>. What is the max amount of money you're willing to spend on a yacht. Be realistic, be cautious. Keep in mind that you will probably put a lot more money into it afterwards, even more if you plan to take it offshore. There is a yacht out there for any budget, but it's important to remember that the cheaper it is the more time and work you will have to put back into it. If time is a factor, you may prefer to pick a turn key yacht. If you have a limited budget, choosing a smaller boat is a smart move. Dock fees are priced on boat length, and every bit of gear gets more pricier when sized up. 8-11 m is the sweet spot when it comes to boats.</p><p>2. <b>Location</b>. Where do you want to be cruising/living? Depending on your goals, it may be better to buy the boat in another country, although this comes with its own set of complications. If you don't have much experience, you're better off choosing a boat near your home grounds. If you do this, you won't have to deal with visas or importation fees. For example, we moved to Vancouver from Montreal to get Pino, it was a good choice and still close to home.</p><p>3. <b>Experience</b>. If you're a novice, starting out smaller is a good idea. Smaller boats give more immediate feedback, you get a feel for the wind and are less likely to make costly mistakes on a larger yatch afterwards.</p><p>4. <b>Comfort</b>. A larger boat is more comfortable on a passage. Race boats (tall rig), like ours, tend to heel a lot, you get used to it, but it may not be ideal for you.</p><p>5. <b>Intentions</b>. If you want to travel the world, your yatch needs to be strong to endure rough waters and strong winds. There is not just one type of blue water boat, you will have to familiarize yourself with the features required for offshore travel.

Usually, this is done through a sales agent.</p><p>If your offer is accepted, the next step is to have a survey of the boat done. The yacht is hauled out of the water, and checked by a marine surveyor. In turn, you receive a document with every detail of the boat, which includes photos and a list of items that need to be looked at/replaced. To buy Pino Devine & I each got a 10,000$ bank loan. We had savings, but didn't want to be left with an empty account after the purchase. That proved to be wise, given the cost of everything marine - we had no idea how bad it was.

add_part(&buying_a_sailboat, "getting certified", "<p>You can get a boat without experience (like we did), but in Canada you need a couple of things first.</p><p>1. <b>Pleasure Craft Operator Card</b>. The test is easy, and covers the basic safety regulations, as well as buoyage. You can do the test online, and the card will be shipped to you afterwards. This test makes sure that you understand how to recognize different buoys, how to navigate alongside other boats etc.</p><p>2. <b>A ROC certificate</b> (radio operator's certificate). You need this to be able to operate a marine VHF radio. Check your area for ROC courses, it costs about 100$ per person. You can buy the manuals and study at home, then take the test on a scheduled date with an examiner. The test is a multiple choice written exam, and includes a few verbal questions about radio calling (need to learn <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet' target='_blank' class='external'>Nato Phonetic Alphabet</a>). You have to take this test, otherwise you won't be permitted to transmit on the radio (you can technically, but you will be in the wrong). Knowing how to talk on a VHF radio is important, especially if you've had an accident and need help.</p><p>3. <b>Security gear</b>. Even if you're just going for a short outing with your boat, you need to get basic safety gear, like lifejackets (one for every person aboard), a medical kit, a PLB or EPIRB, good <a href='sailing.html#ground_tackle'>ground tackle</a> etc.</p><p>4. <b>Changing your boat name</b>. First of all, ignore whatever anyone tells you about it being bad luck. Having a name that means something to you is important. In Canada, changing your boat name will cost you 250$ and the wait time varies, it can take 1-2 months. You can visit <a href='http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety/oep-vesselreg-registration-menu-2311.htm' target='_blank' class='external'>Transport Canada</a> for information on how to do it.

Then finally, I rinse them off with fresh running water and let them dry in the sun. They need to be completely dry, otherwise they may rot faster (moisture accelerates rot).</p><p>Washing your produce in baking soda prevents foodborne illness and substantially reduces your exposure to pesticides, it is more effective than using a vinegar solution (because it needs to be used full-strength, and that can get expensive). This washing technique is the same for fresh greens and fruits, although for berries, it is best to wash them right before you plan to eat them.</p>");

There are a lot of these events in places where foreigners on yachts tend to gather. We attended swap meets in La Paz (mexico), Vava'u (tonga) and soon we'll go to the one in Whangarei.</p>");
add_part(&used_goods, "used marine goods", "<p>If you live in a big city with lots of sailors and marinas, chances are there will be a good used marine goods shop around. Many cruisers opt to sell their gear there or to put their items on consignment (thusly eliminating the need to actively search for buyers).</p><p>If you know what you are looking for, you'll most likely find it, or you'll find something very near to it. Second hand shops are full of bins consisting of cryptic metal parts and angry tangles of wire, the quantity and diversity of it all can be quite intimidating. We have often left more confused than we started, it's for this reason that you need to enter stores like this with a plan.</p><p>Stores like this will often sell used sails too, even sail shops sometimes have some pretty sweet deals.</p><p>Examples:  Stanley Marine in Whangarei, Blue Pelican in San Francisco, Minney's yacht surplus in Costa Mesa etc.</p><p>*Note that all of these places have big yacht concentrations. The more boats there are, the more used gear you will find.</p>");
add_part(&used_goods, "local notice boards", "<p>It's a good idea to look at marina notice boards when foreign yachts start populating your area. We've seen many ads with amazing deals: lots of cheap dinghies, outboards, paddle boards etc. More often than not, people are just passing through and want to get rid of items quickly.</p><p>We walk by the marina office everyday, and always stop to look for new notices. This is how we got our extra solar panels. We purchased two 90W solar panels for 150$ from an older English couple, they sold these panels to upgrade to larger models (they have more electronics and toys than we do). We've installed them already and they work perfectly, the owner of the boat even came to help us set them up.</p>");
add_part(&used_goods, "marina trash", "<p>Every time we bring recycling to the marina bins, we look at the trash to see if there are any goodies. One time in New Zealand, we found a working 600W inverter with american-style outlets. Chances are the owner wanted to upgrade to a higher wattage, and didn't think it worth while to sell this one (given the voltage). There aren't that made north american yachts passing through NZ on a yearly basis, and the ones that are there are not necessarily looking for inverters (most yachts need bigger inverters than this). This was a godsend for us, we needed to upgrade our little 250W.</p><p>If you keep your boat near a big city where lots of racers congregate, chances are the marinas in the area will have bins with lots of good gear. Racing yachts are particular about their boats, some count the number of tacks they make and replace the sail when they reach a certain number. I imagine the sail's performance may be reduced, but to a cruiser or tinkerer, there are many things one can do with an old sail. Friends of ours have found great-looking sails in trash bins around big marinas in Auckland.</p><p>We've seen entire boat ovens, rigging wire and jabsco toilets in bins. While these items may not be working, sometimes you can salvage parts. We've collected many items over the past 2 years, we almost always find a use for them*.</p><p>*Note: in no way do we want to become hoarders, it's important to be selective in your findings. Otherwise, after a year of accumulation, it's always a good idea to review what you have and to get rid of stuff. <a href='used_goods.html#swap_meets'>Swap meets</a> are great for that.</p>");
add_part(&used_goods, "thrift stores", "<p>Back when we lived on land we moved a lot, instead of purchasing new items, we would get them at thrift stores and then return the items when they were no longer needed. In Montreal, we purchased items from Les Petits freres, a store who's proceeds goes into helping the elderly, in turn, they could help themselves to items in the store for free. The items you give and take serve a much greater purpose than you think.</p><p>Recently, Devine & I wanted to buy a sewing machine so we could do some projects on the boat. Most of the machines we saw in store didn't fit our budget. There is also the fact that we have limited knowledge of such things, and turned to our sailing friends for model suggestions.</p><p>Most of the people we know carry a sailrite, a heavy-duty sewing machine (that weighs as much as we do) with which you can do sail and canvas repair. Buying a new sailrite will cost you anywhere from 650-1300$US dollars, if you consider the cost of sail repair it is a good deal (but not one we can afford).</p><p>The good news is many sailors carry sailrites or sewing machines. You can ask to use theirs, we did this while in San Francisco, and repaired our mainsail cover with it. It never hurts to ask, and sharing is nice isn't it?</p>");

add_part(&markl, "production", "<p>Markl is our second game collaboration. We started production of this game in 2016, around the same time we created Hundredrabbits. We had illusions of productivity in those first few months, with learning how to sail and adapting to off-grid living we found work/life difficult to balance. We put hours into the project every week, but when we left Canada to sail south to Mexico we found less and less time to work on it. The reason was simple, this project required connectivity and power — two things we had little of. Markl was not suited for our current situation, and so we put it on the backburner, we instead chose to work on smaller projects like <a href='thousand_rooms.html' target='_self' class='local'>Thousand Rooms</a> and <a href='left.html' target='_self' class='local'>Left</a>.</p><p>Markl also proved to be very challenging, from a programming perspective. Devine is a self-taught programmer, and is learning all the time. Markl was a monster we weren't ready for.</p><p>By the time we arrived in the South Pacific Islands, we needed to pay more attention to the tools we were working with. Tools like Photoshop and Xcode weren't well suited for off-grid low-power living — these, at the time, we needed to complete Markl. We had our eyes set on New Zealand then, thinking that this would be the ideal place to work on such a project, but again, life got in the way. Pino required a lot of repairs. We spent many months in a windowless home, exposed to the elements, making it difficult to focus. During this time, Rekka turned to projects like <a href='https://www.wiktopher.kokorobot.ca' target='_blank' class='external'>Wiktopher</a>, and Devine to <a href='dotgrid.html' target='_self' class='local'>Dotgrid</a>. We also made the decision to distance ourselves from the Apple environment, abandoning xcode, requiring us to re-build the game, yet again, for the better.</p><p>On this voyage across the Pacific, we prioritized our tools rather than our creations because our situation required it. We think this process was very important, even if it greatly delayed the production and release of this project. Devine also acquired the skills to complete the game, while working on projects like <a href='orca.html' target='_self' class='local'>Orca</a>.</p><p>Markl will be released, we hope, sometime in 2020.</p>");

What options are there to stay longer?</p><h3>In and Out of the country</h3><p>You can only do this once, in any 6 month period so don't count on repeating it after that time. There is a ferry that runs from Fukuoka to Busan that is cheap, and that makes a good option for making a short exit.</p><h3>Applying for an extension</h3><p>If after 6 months, you can't leave for whatever reason, you can apply for an <b>extension</b>, but extensions are only ever granted in emergencies(boat in need of repairs, bad oceanic weather, etc).</p><p>To find out more about the extension process, visit the website of the <a href='http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/english/tetuduki/zairyuu/koushin.html' target='_blank' class='external'>immigration bureau of Japan</a>.

If this is your plan, you can sail up the west coast of Japan and exit the country through Tsushima to make the sail to Korea. Canadians can stay in Korea 6 months, but many other nationalities are granted only 90 days. Extensions are difficult to obtain. If you're planning on staying longer than a 90-day, a special long-term visa must be obtained in advance and you will have to apply for a residence certificate at the local immigration office.</p><p>Busan isn't ideal to keep your boat for long periods of time, but there are plenty of other places to go. A friend mentioned <a href='https://www.noonsite.com/Countries/SouthKorea/Mokpo' target='_blank' class='external'>Mokpo</a> as being a good, cheap place to keep a boat for a long period, but it's a longer sail than Busan.</p><h3>Leave the boat in Japan for 6 months</h3><p>Your boat is allowed to stay, but you aren't, so one option is to leave your boat in a safe place in Japan for 6 months and to return home.

add_part(&sailing_in_japan, "sailing at night", "<p>Sailing in Japan is different than other places in the world, in the way that sailing at night is strongly discouraged, due to the presence of nets, floats, algae and fish farms. When sailing through the inland sea, a watch at the bow is necessary, even in daytime, so this can give you an idea of what it may be like at night. A lot of fishermen don't have AIS, and not always on watch at night either so it's best to keep transit times short and during the daylight hours. If a longer passage is necessary, sailing offshore may help to avoid dangers. There is also offshore traffic to consider, especially near and around the Kii peninsula.</p><p>If you plan to sail extensively through Japan, chances are you'll be mooring in many small fishing harbours onto a concrete piers. The walls may, or may not have big rubber bits, and some will have gaps that make it difficult to protect your boat using only fenders. In all cases, having a fenderboard is useful, it will keep your fenders from going into the gaps of the dock and will protect them from the rough concrete pier. The big rubber bits that many ports have can help to protect your boat, but will leave marks.</p>");

Many convenience stores will have bins outside of their store for recyclables, although generally they prefer it to be used for their own products, but if you don't have any other options it's better to leave your pet bottles, cans and plastics here. They'll usually have a bin for burnable trash too, usually labelled as 燃えるゴミ, the Japanese word for garbage is <i>gomi</i>.</p><p>Another way to get rid of garbage, is to get the city's schedule for the disposal of items and to leave them on the street along with the recyclables and/or trash of your neighbours. If you can't find a schedule, just take a peek at what is out on the curb and that should make it clear what you can and can't bring out on that particular day. Although make sure to take it out on the right day, because every item has its own pickup time and day. If you want to put your trash and recyclables with that of others, do it right, because otherwise the truck will not pick it up and label it with a sticker.

While in Shima Yacht Harbour, we had to buy new Japanese-style tanks because they refused to fill ours — may have been because of their aged appearance. The issue with Japanese tanks is that they are tall and skinny, and only get taller as their volume increases. Our propane locker is made for a short and stout 9 kg (20 lbs) tank, we can't fit a Japanese tank of similar volume because of its increased height. This resulted in us purchasing two smaller 5 kg tanks, which isn't ideal, but better than not having the ability to cook food — I think you'll agree.

add_part(&sailing_in_japan, "language", "<p>Most Japanese speak little to no English, if you need help, try and find a younger person. Young teens learn English in school and are usually happy to lend a hand. Otherwise, drawing pictures is always fun :).

Katakana has 45 letters, you can use the app <b>Duolingo</b> to learn them. Another cool thing, is that with katakana you'll be able to write your own name in japanese, for instance, mine is: レーカベールム(rekka berumu). In Japanese, 'L's become 'R's, it butchers English names a little but it is still very fun. A celebrity name like Nicole Kiddman becomes ニコルキドマン (Nikoru Kidoman).</p><p><b>Hiragana</b> is the next step, if you want to learn even more. Hiragana is used to write verb conjugations and for particles, if you pick up a children's book you'll also notice that it will be written using hiragana alone. If you know hiragana, you'll be able to read many things!</p><p><b>Kanji</b> is more of a challenge, but learning a few is always fun and helpful. For this step, you can go through the varying levels of the JLPT (Japanese language proficiency test). This is for those who are really into languages.

Many japanese sailors never anchor, they only do in emergencies or when med-mooring.

All are relatively sheltered, within concrete breakwaters. Some ports will charge nothing, others very little, even for extended stays.</p><p>Fishing harbours require you to moor onto a concrete wall. If planning to moor in a place like this, it is best to arrive at high tide. When coming alongside at low tide, getting onto the pier may be difficult, not just this, the wall will be encrusted in barnacles and in big winds it may be difficult to moor without damaging your yacht (even with big fenders on).</p><p>Using a sturdy fenderboard, with big fenders underneath, is necessary. You will have to adjust your lines with the tide, keep a close eye on the height of it to avoid bad surprises. (Sometimes the tide is so high the fenderboard or fenders pop up onto the dock.)</p><h3>Harbour pontoons</h3><p>In some ports, you'll be able to dock onto a small pontoon. The places reserved for visitors will be marked by yellow and black stripes. If there is no more room, find any place you can and ask if it's okay to stay there, otherwise, it may be necessary to tie to another boat; although, again, it's better to ask because not all boats will appreciate you tying to their yacht.</p><p>These will usually cost more than tying to a wall, they often belong to fishing/yacht clubs or hotels, but have the advantage of rising and falling with the tide.</p>");

add_part(&provisioning_in_japan, "condiments", "<p>Japan has many condiments, I'll go through the most popular ones, listing their properties and uses.</p><h3>Mirin</h3><p>Mirin, or 味醂 or みりん, is a condiment in Japanese cuisine. It's a type of rice wine but with a lower alcohol and higher sugar content than sake. The sugars form naturally during the fermentation process, and are not added.</p><p>There are 3 types: Hon mirin (true mirin), which contains about 14% alcohol, second is Shio mirin which has less alcohol (lower than 1.5%) and third is Shin mirin, which has less than 1% alcohol while retaining the same flavor.</p><p>Mirin adds sweetness to dishes, it helps tenderize foods while masking unwanted flavors and adds luster to dishes.</p><h3>Soy sauce</h3><p>Soy sauce, called Shoyu in Japanese (醤油), is a staple of Japanese cuisine and is as ubiquitous as salt. The Japanese use is to flavor and enhance dishes, to season ingredients, to enhance the color of dishes and to make sauces and dressings.</p><p>Japanese soy sauce is more delicate than Chinese, Korean or Thai soy sauce. It has a complex umami flavor. There are 3 types:</p><ul class='bullet'><li>Koikuchi shoyu (濃口醤油, dark-colored soy sauce)</li><li>Usukuchi shoyu (薄口醤油, light-colored soy sauce)</li><li>Amakuchi shoyu (甘口, sweet soy sauce)</li></ul><p>Koikuchi is available in Eastern Japan, it is dark-colored with a slight fruity flavor. It's made with a higher ratio of soybeans, and is sometimes produced without wheat. Usukuchi is light, and has a saltier taste, it is preferred in the West of Japan. Light soy sauce is ideal to make noodle soup or simmered dishes. Amakuchi soy sauce is sweet and common in Southern Japan.</p><h3>Miso</h3><p>Miso, or みそ, is a traditional Japanese seasoning produced by fermenting soybeans with both salt and koji (fungus Aspergillus oryzae) and sometimes with rice, barley and seaweed. Miso is salty, but it's flavor and aroma depends on the ingredients used or the fermentation process. There is a wide variety of Japanese miso, it is typically classified by grain type (barley, buckwheat, rice etc), color (white, brown, black & red), taste (sweet 甘味噌, mild 甘口味噌, salty 辛口味噌, earthy, fruity etc) and background (where it's from). The most common miso flavor categories are:</p><ul class='bullet'><li>Shiromiso 白味噌 (white)</li><li>Akamiso 赤味噌 (red)</li><li>Awasemiso 合わせ味噌 (mixed)</li></ul><p>Miso is delicious when used in soup, as a dressing for salad, in ramen, as a flavouring for tofu etc</p><h3>Rice vinegar</h3><p>Japanese Rice vinegar 米酢 'komezu' or simply 'su' has a very mild taste, and is either colorless or yellow. Japanese rice vinegar is made from rice. This type of vinegar is less acidic than Chinese varieties, and are used to season rice, and for making 'sunomono' (vinegar dishes) and 'tsukemono' (pickles). There are some kinds of Japanese rice vinegars that are 'seasoned', meaning that they have additives like sake, salt and sugar, for added flavor. Seasoned varieties include 'sushizu'.</p><p>Rice vinegar is known for its anti-bacterial properties.</p><h3>Dashi</h3><p>Dashi is a soup stock and essential condiment in Japanese cuisine. Dashi contains one or two ingredients, and is often made from konbu 昆布だし (dried kelp), katsuoboshi (dried bonito flakes), shiitake (mushrooms), iriko/niboshi (dried anchovies/sardines) or a combination of these. Dashi creates a sweet, savoury umami flavor.</p><p>Dashi is used as a broth base for Japanese hot pot dishes, simmered dishes, noodle soups, it's also used as a seasoning liquid (for rice). Konbu dashi is the easiest stock to make, it has a subtle taste and is often mixed with shiitake dashi. The mushrooms used to make shiitake dashi are used for cooking.<p>");

add_part(&ogasawara_cruising_guide, "arriving in chichijima", "<p>The port of Chichijima is very easy to navigate through, even at night, all is well-marked and well-lit. To check-in, you need to head deep into Futami Port. As you enter, you will likely see a ferry docked on your port side, and continue past the breakwater to your starboard side. The dock will be on your port side. As of February 2019, they are building an extension to the dock that provides a bit more shelter in SW winds. This dock isn't charted, so if you arrive at night be careful. The end of the dock is lit.</p><p>The dock is quite high, and there is only one ladder. It is likely you'll be the only boat there, so aim for the ladder when docking. The pier has big rubber bits to protect your boat (although they do stain), even the ladder is made of thick rubber and won't damage your yacht. You'll need to wrap your lines around big yellow bollards. You won't have to worry about your lines chafing on the dock because they've added a rounded rubber edge to it — Japanese are so thoughtful in that way.</p><ul><li><b>Position at dock: 27 5.921'N 142 12.013'E</b></li></ul><p>When you arrive, stay on the boat and don't go on land. It is likely that the JCG will be there waiting for you, with the officials lined up to check you in. If you arrive very late, the JCG will be there anyway to give you instructions (as was the case for us, since we arrived at 9pm). They will give you a time for check in on the next day. Weekend check-ins are no problem, we did it on a Saturday.</p><img src='../media/content/japan.ogasawara.jpg'/>");

They may or may not confiscate them, I had none aboard when they came and so they took nothing. I had many dried legumes, grains aboard in jars that they saw, but they didn't care to take them. You can see a list of prohibited items <a href='https://www.la.us.emb-japan.go.jp/e_web/e_m02_08.htm' target='_blank' class='external'>here</a>.</p><p><b>Customs Officials</b> will ask you about your last and future ports, they will ask for precise dates. Because making a long list of planned ports is no longer necessary, you only need to give them a general list.</p><p>They will give you a <b>Closed port permit</b>, that will give you blanket permission to visit all “closed ports” (which basically means everywhere in Japan that is not an open port, including anchorages) for as long as you are in Japan.</p><p>You will also get a <b>Naiko Senpaku</b> (domestic boat) registration that will waive the requirement for you to to port entry/exit Customs paperwork in open and closed ports (although you are still required to do port entry/exit Coast Guard paperwork for open ports, but actual requirements vary by port).</p><p><b>Immigration</b> will ask you to step off the boat and likely take you into an office to do the paperwork. You will fill a card like they have on planes, and they will take a photo of you as well as a scan of your index fingers, again, this is the same sort of machine they have at airports. They'll ask you to fill many papers, all of these have English writing. Most travelers are allowed 3 months on a tourist visa, although your boat can stay in Japan indefinitely.</p><p>They will ask you if you need to take on gas and water, and how much.

Know that you can change your mind, especially if the delay is weather-related, they will understand but they will want a precise date from you. This isn't because they want you to leave, but because they need and want to know. There will be papers to fill before leaving (even if you're not checking out of Japan).</p><p>You'll be filling out papers with your departure date and time, as well as your intended destination port. You may or may not get a visit by immigration and customs at your next port (each port has its own rules).

If you walk, or cycle down the main rode to the east of the bay, you'll end up in another small town called <b>Ougiura</b>. Although there is not very much there, aside from walking trails, beaches and some hotels. You can take a bus from Omura to get further inland, if you do you can get to USK coffee, a very special cafe where the owner grows and roasts his own coffee — note that it is very expensive, ~ JPY 1000 per cup. You can also visit the place where the Ogasawara salt is processed, some ways up the road.</p><p>There are many remnants of the war here, many structures left behind that you can visit.

There is also a bin with the word burnable garbage (燃えるゴミ) on it, you can use this to throw away food scraps and products marked with プラ (plastic is lumped in with the burnables, but separated at a nearby facility). The word for garbage is 'gomi'.</p><p>Throwing away recyclabes like carboard ('danboru' 段ぼる) and paper is a bit more complicated, as there are no bins to dispose of them in town.

add_part(&vegan_in_japan, "japanese vegan ingredients", "<img src='../media/content/vegan.3.jpg'/><h3>Nagaimo 長芋</h3><p>This tuber is a good egg alternative when baking both sweet and savory dishes. When grated, it becomes slimy and thick. The resulting texture makes it ideal as a binding agent (like eggs). Nagaimo imparts little flavor. It is perfect for okonomiyaki.</p><h3>Fu 麩</h3><p> Fu is refined gluten protein. Making wheat gluten requires separating wheat flour into starch and protein by rinsing the starch away, leaving raw gluten. In Japan, the two main forms of fu are raw 生麩nama-fu, and dry-baked 焼き麩 yaki-fu.</p><p>Nama-fu 生麩 : Solid gluten mixed with glutinous rice flour and millet, steamed in large blocks. It's shaped and colored in a variety of ways. Nama-fu is ideal for confectionary, sold with sweet red bean paste fillings.</p><p>Yaki-fu 焼き麩 : Gluten leavened with baking powder and baked into long bread-like sticks. The sticks aren't sold in supermarkets, but you'll find them in cut form, hard dry discs resembling croutons or bread rusk. Yaki-fu is typically added to miso soup and sukiyaki, where it absorbs some of the broth and acquires a fine texture.</p><h3>Konnyaku こんにゃく</h3><p>A potato processed into a jelly-like substance. Konnyaku is delicious when eaten as faux-sashimi with soy sauce and wasabi. It's low-calorie, and high in fiber.</p><h3>Kanten かんてん</h3><p>Kanten comes from red edible seaweed and  is the binding ingredient in jelly-desserts. It produces a harder jelly than agar agar.</p>");

You'd think that in Japan soy milk would be popular as a drink, but it is more often used in cooking.

Coffee shops in districts like Shibuya are more likely to have some.</p><p>If you walk up to a vending machine selling canned coffee, you'll see many varieties but almost all them contain milk, all, except coffee labelled as 'black' like 'Boss black coffee'.

add_part(&vegan_in_japan, "desserts", "<p>Finding vegan desserts in Japan is very easy! Here are few suggestions:</p><p><b>花林糖 Karintou</b>. A sweet and deep-fried dessert, made with flour, yeast and brown sugar, usually sold into fingerling shapes.</p><p><b>羊羹 Yokan.</b> A jelly dessert made from red bean paste, agar agar (seaweed) and sugar. It's often sold in individual blocks. There are 4 main types: neri yokan and 水羊羹 mizu yokan, 蒸し羊羹 mushi yokan and 栗蒸し羊羹 kuri mushi yokan. Neri yokan is made with red bean paste, agar and sugar, Mizu yokan shares these basic ingredients but has a higher water content, mushi yokan is steamed and uses kuzu (arrowroot) instead of agar and kuri mushi yokan is like mushi yokan but with added chestnuts. Yokan often has added flavourings, which ranges from green tea, to black sesame, strawberry, houjicha etc. There's even salty varieties.</p><p><b>饅頭, まんじゅう Manjuu.</b> A sweet bun, with an outside made from flour, rice powder, kuzu or buckwheat, and with a filling of red bean paste. There are two types, baked manjuu and steamed manjuu. There are many regional varieties that have different fillings and shapes.</p><p><b>餅, もち Mochi</b>. A rice cake made from glutinous rice, and sometimes water, sugar and cornstarch. The rice is pounded into a a paste and molded into a shape. Mochi is served with a variety of toppings, like kinako (roasted soybean flour), shiso heaf (salted cherry leaf) or green tea powder.</p><p><b>蕨餅 Warabimochi.</b> A jelly-like dessert made from warabi kuzu (bracken starch) and covered or dipped in kinako (roasted soybean flour). In stores, you'll likely find versions made with other starches, like potato or tapioca starch. 本わらび粉 (honwarabiko) 100% bracken root powder is rare, as if it difficult to harvest and only a small amount of its roots becomes starch.</p>"); 
add_part(&vegan_in_japan, "chocolate", "<p>In Japan, 'chocolate products' are classified on a complex scale, and most contain milk, but it is possible to find some.

Processed quasi chocolate products are made from quasi chocolate material itself or containing at least 60% quasi chocolate material.</p>");
add_part(&vegan_in_japan, "general tips", "<p>Some convenience stores sell snacks and have little illustrations on the front that tell you which allergy-prone item is present. Many contain milk or eggs.</p><p>In some restaurants, ordering a dish called 'Yasai kare' or 'Vegetable curry' doesn't mean there won't be meat in it, they sometimes add it anyway. When ordering it's better to ask if there is meat or fish in it.</p><p>Buying bread that doesn't have added milk, egg or butter is difficult. It's possible to find, but finding them requires patience as <a href='https://isitveganjapan.com/food-products/bread-and-bakery-products/' target='_blank' class='external'>this article</a> attests.</p>");

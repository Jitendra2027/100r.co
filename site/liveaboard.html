We decided against getting a soda stream given the fact that its bottles are proprietary and cannot be filled by anyone other than them. Making your own system is way better, and if you've got a big tank it'll last for a long, long time.</p><p>Here's what you'll need to get, this is also the order in which you need to connect them together:</p><ul><li>5KG CO2 tank</li><li>A regulator</li><li>1m of of vinyl tubing</li><li>A ball-lock keg coupler</li><li>A carbonator bottle cap</li><li>A soda bottle (for carbonation with a reinforced bottom).</li></ul><p>For a full tutorial, check out this <a href='https://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2012-06/how-make-your-own-home-carbonation-system#page-4' target='_blank' class='external'>site</a>.</p><h2 id='habitat'>habitat</h2><p>As with most things in life, 20% of anything does 80% of the work. When moving into a smaller space, it is important to find that 20% and surround yourself with things purposefully. Single-serving tools and kitchenware will not do.</p><p>Investing in good quality <b>army blankets and waterproof sleepingbags</b> will make a world of difference. Non-metallic(bamboo or ceramic) kitchenware is also essential, everything rusts on a boat - even stainless-steel. To keep our clothes dry, we store them in large sealed industrial plastic containers.</p><h2 id='washing_fresh_produce'>washing fresh produce</h2><img src='../media/content/knowledge/washing.jpg'/><p>After buying fresh produce at the market, I wash everything with baking soda. If there's a lot of dirt, I scrub them with a brush. The mechanical rubbing action and rinsing is very good at removing contaminants. Then finally, I rinse them off with fresh running water and let them dry in the sun. They need to be completely dry, otherwise they may rot faster (moisture accelerates rot).</p><p>Washing your produce in baking soda prevents foodborne illness and substantially reduces your exposure to pesticides, it is more effective than using a vinegar solution (because it needs to be used full-strength, and that can get expensive). This washing technique is the same for fresh greens and fruits, although for berries, it is best to wash them right before you plan to eat them.</p><h2 id='costs'>costs</h2><p>Living at <b>anchor</b> - that is, in a bay somewhere tethered to the earth with ground tackle, is usually <b>free</b>. Some bays will have <b>moorings</b> installed, that can be used for a <b>small fee</b> (often around 10-15$.) Marinas often have guest <b>docks</b> with power, wifi and showers, for a <b>medium-to-high cost</b> (400$-600$.) The longer the boat though, the bigger the cost. Some marinas though, charge per dock space rather than boat size, beware of these places.</p><h2 id='water_storage'>water storage</h2><p>Our main tank carries 170L, while an additional 150L is stored in jerry cans. When it is not possible to dock at a marina, we use smaller(4x10L) jerry cans to ferry water from shore. While it requires more trips, the lighter containers are less prone to breakage.</p><h2 id='electricity'>electricity</h2><img src='../media/content/knowledge/leds.jpg'/><p>We have 4 Solar Panels(1 x 60W, 1 x 100W and 2 X 90W). For additional power, we also carry a Honda EU1000i generator. Our boat has a 75AMP Balmar alternator, but it is only used when we need to use high-power systems like the macerator, or if we need to charge the batteries by other means on a cloudy day. Every single light is LED, cutting down the consumption of power, from lights, by 10 compared to halogens.</p><h2 id='privacy'>privacy</h2><p>There is none. It's something you must prepare for. If you have plans to travel for extended periods of time with another person, you must be compatible, you must discuss problems when they arise and express concerns right away.</p><p>The combined space, below and atop deck, is bigger than it seems. If you are near land, there is always the option of going for a walk.</p><h2 id='laundry'>laundry</h2><p>In populated cities, we carry dirty clothes ashore to a laundromat. If there aren't any, we do our own washing. We wash them by hand with <a href='off_the_grid.html#rain_catchment'>collected rain water</a>, a set of buckets and a brush. The clothes are brushed and washed in soapy water once, then rinsed in fresh water.</p><p>For white clothes, or stained garments, we like to soak them in a bucket with some <a href='https://www.chemistrystore.com/sodium_percarbonate2.pdf' target='_blank'>sodium percarbonate</a>. It destains, deodorizes, whitens and is non-toxic to marine life. It breaks down to oxygen, water and sodium carbonate (soda ash) in your wash water.</p><p>When underway during long passages, we tend to wear the same clothes for a long, long time. If ever we do need to wash clothes, we'll do a quick salt water wash to save water, and rinse with fresh water. The clothes is hung out to dry on the lifelines, or on a separate line that we set up. Leaving dark clothes out to dry in the sun will cause it to discolour faster - such is the cost of sailing in warm places.</p><h2 id='washing_dishes'>washing dishes</h2><p>We clean our dishes with boiling water, baking soda (for stains, breaking down grease), vinegar and homemade dishwashing liquid (castile soap-based). It's non-invasive, non-toxic to marine life and is great at removing fat and dirt. The dishes are then left to air-dry outside in the sun. When water is scarce, we clean/rinse the dishes using salt water scooped up from the side of the boat (using a bucket attached to a rope), we also try and use treated rain water, as much as possible.</p><p>Our freshwater foot pump pulls water from our tanks and dispenses it to the  galley's sink at the rate of approximately a 1/4 cup per push. This system allows us to calculate water-consumption and storage.</p><h3>Like what you read?<h3><hr/></main><footer><p>Never miss an update</p><form action='https://tinyletter.com/hundredrabbits' method='post' target='popupwindow' onsubmit='window.open('https://tinyletter.com/hundredrabbits', 'popupwindow', 'scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=600');return true'><input type='email' value='' name='EMAIL' class='email' placeholder='email@address.com' required=''><input type='submit' value='Subscribe' name='subscribe' class='button'></form></footer></body></html>

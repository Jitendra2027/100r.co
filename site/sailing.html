As soon as you think of reefing down, do it. Should we reduce sails? Yes, always yes.</p><p>Shaking out a reef is easier than putting one in in big winds.</p><h2 id='no_schedules'>no schedules</h2><p>Sailing with a schedule is a recipe for disaster, too many things can happen on a boat and arriving on a precise date can be difficult. Making plans will make you do bad decisions, leaving in bad weather to make a meeting for instance, can be dangerous. Sail with the weather, not against it.</p><h2 id='ground_tackle'>ground tackle</h2><p>We carry 3 anchors onboard. We have a Bruce 10 kg, and a Rocna 10 kg and 15 kg. Some will argue that bigger is better, but in our experience the quality and shape of the anchor, as well as your scope makes all the difference. If you want to upsize, your bow roller may need replacing, and in the event of windlass breakage, heaving it up by hand could be next to impossible. We extra lenghts of chain and rope.</p><p>We carry 30.5m of chain on <a href='pino.html' target='_self' class='local'>Pino</a>, with 61m of 3-strand nylon. This means that we anchor safely in waters no deeper than 11m, we have found plenty of anchorages in the South Pacific in that depth range.</p><h2 id='eliminating_electricity'>eliminating electricity</h2><p>Our aim is to have as few items as possible on board that demand power. More power means more batteries, solar panels, wiring and devices that are sensitive to salt.</p><h2 id='no_refrigeration'>no refrigeration</h2><p>We have no refrigeration, we live well wthout it. We don't drink nut milks anymore, because the average-sized tetrapak containers don't stay fresh for more than 3 days. If you want nut milks aboard, carrying it in powder form will help in a bind.</p><p>Most condiments don't need refrigeration. Hot sauces, soy sauce, all vinegars, mirin, jam and other items, if used regularly, will fair just fine in cupboards.</p><p>Refrigerated vegetables will rot faster, but leaving them out and wiping off the excess moisture will help. Buying market vegetables that have never been refrigerated are ideal. On long passages, prioritize root vegetables. Items like peppers and leafy greens will spoil quickly, and should be eaten first.</p><p>Leftovers we eat the next day, incorporating it into other meals to offer some variety. Preparing food in the pressure cooker, and letting it rest unopened will help preserve the food. If left overnight, it can be reheated in the morning and will keep well until lunchtime.</p><h2 id='seasickness'>seasickness</h2><p>Here's a few of our tricks against seasickness.</p><ul><li>Don't drink alcohol or coffee the day before leaving.</li><li>Eat before you're hungry.</li><li>Rest before you're tired.</li><li>Don't let yourself get cold.</li><li>If everything else fails, take the helm.</li></ul><hr/></main><footer><p>Never miss an update</p><form action='https://tinyletter.com/hundredrabbits' method='post' target='popupwindow' onsubmit='window.open('https://tinyletter.com/hundredrabbits', 'popupwindow', 'scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=600');return true'><input type='email' value='' name='EMAIL' class='email' placeholder='email@address.com' required=''><input type='submit' value='Subscribe' name='subscribe' class='button'></form></footer></body></html>

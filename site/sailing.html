As soon as you think of reefing down, do it. Should we reduce sails? yes, always yes.</p><p>Better be safe than sorry. Reefing early will save you a lot of problems, shaking out a reef is easier than putting one in in big winds.</p><h2 id='no_schedules'>no schedules</h2><p>Sailing with a schedule is a recipe for disaster, too many things can happen on a boat and arriving on a precise date can be difficult. Making plans will make you do bad decisions, leaving in bad weather to make a meeting for instance, can be dangerous.</p><h2 id='ground_tackle'>ground tackle</h2><p>We carry 3 anchors onboard, we have a Rocna 10kg and a 15kg. Some will argue that bigger is better, but in our experience the quality and shape of the anchor, as well as your scope makes all the difference. If you want to upsize, your bow roller may need replacing, and in the event of windlass breakage, heaving it up by hand could be next to impossible. We also carry a Bruce 10, with extra lenghts of chain and rope.</p><p>We carry 30.5m of chain on <a href='pino.html' target='_self' class='local'>Pino</a>, with 61m of 3-strand nylon. This means that we anchor safely in waters no deeper than 11m, we have found plenty of anchorages in the south pacific in that depth range.</p><h2 id='eliminating_electricity'>eliminating electricity</h2><p>Our aim is to have as few items as possible on board that demand power. We would like to have a manual windlass, and a composting head. A manual windlass would use no power at all, and eliminate all wiring, thusly minimizing the possibilty of corosion. A composting head would eliminate the need for a macerator, and for a sceptic tank. Our sceptic tank is 113 L, if we could get rid of it we could replace it with 113 L of fresh water instead.</p><h2 id='no_refrigeration'>no refrigeration</h2><p>We have no refrigeration, because it draws too much and we've realized we can live well without it. We don't drink nut milks anymore, because the average-sized tetrapak containers don't stay fresh for more than 3 days, we've wasted too much nut milk, having none aboard is better. If you want nut milks aboard, carrying it in powder form will help in a bind, also, a good breakfast milk can be made using oat water. Grind oats finely, into a powder, pour into a bottle and shake, voila, cheap and easy oat milk.</p><p>Most condiments don't need refrigeration, then again we don't use any dairy-based products or items like ketchup. Hot sauces, soy sauce, all vinegars, mirin, jam, lemon juice and other items, if used regularly, will fair just fine in cupboards.</p><p>Refrigerated vegetables will rot faster, but leaving them out and wiping off the excess moisture will help. Buying market vegetables that have never been refrigerated are best - root vegetables will last an especially long time. Items like peppers and leafy greens will spoil quickly, and should be eaten first.</p><p>Leftovers we eat the next day, incorporating it into other meals to offer some variety. Preparing food in the pressure cooker, and letting it rest unopened will help preserve the food. If left overnight, it can be reheated in the morning and will keep well until lunchtime.</p><h2 id='seasickness'>seasickness</h2><p>Here's a few of our tricks against seasickness.</p><ul class='bullet'><li>Don't drink alcohol or coffee the day before leaving.</li><li>Eat before you're hungry.</li><li>Rest before you're tired.</li><li>Don't let yourself get cold.</li><li>If everything else fails, take the helm.</li></ul><hr/></main><footer><p>Never miss an update</p><form action='https://tinyletter.com/hundredrabbits' method='post' target='popupwindow' onsubmit='window.open('https://tinyletter.com/hundredrabbits', 'popupwindow', 'scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=600');return true'><input type='email' value='' name='EMAIL' class='email' placeholder='email@address.com' required=''><input type='submit' value='Subscribe' name='subscribe' class='button'></form></footer></body></html>

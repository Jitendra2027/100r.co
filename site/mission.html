Along with the creation of content, we have also allocated time to contributing and maintaining the open-source projects of others.</p><p><a href='http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/Dotgrid' target='_blank' class='external'>Dotgrid</a>, like <a href='http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/Left' target='_blank' class='external'>Left</a>, was originally created to be used internally, but has now grown into something used by thousands of creators. The development of the application was done following the <a href='http://wiki.xxiivv.com/the+bazaar+model' target='_blank' class='external'>Bazaar Model</a>, as opposed to the <a href='http://wiki.xxiivv.com/the+cathedral+model' target='_blank' class='external'>Cathedral Model</a>, in which the source code is developed over the Internet in view of the public. It allowed for a <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Dotgrid/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed' target='_blank' class='external'>conversation</a> to occur between us and other Dotgrid users, seeing how differently each person used the tool revealed new directions toward which we could grow the software, and in return, new ways for us to use it as well.</p><p>Through these exchanges, we've encountered amazing people who have grown into friends and long-term collaborators.</p><p>Our intermitent internet connection makes for unpredictable release patterns, and spotty technical support, but allowing users to fix their own issues, encouraged people to learn, help each other to find solutions, and submit revisions for everyone to enjoy.</p><h2 id='energy_usage'>energy usage</h2><p>We create light-weight tools in an attempt at reducing our broader environmental impact.</p><p>The energy required to power tools like X code and Photoshop keeps growing, and the updates are large and incessant — Photoshop has long stopped adding worthwhile upgrades. Heavier software increase energy usage and shorten the lifetime of our solar-powered computers. Greenhouse gas emissions in production are high. This is worrying, because an estimated 130,000 computers ends up in the garbage annually.</p><p>All of our tools work offline and operate on low-power devices. We can keep creating content when off-grid, when our power and connectivity is limited.</p><p>We developed these tools out of necessity, because <a href='tools_ecosystem.html' target='_self' class='local'>our situation required it</a>.</p><hr/></main><footer><p>Never miss an update</p><form action='https://tinyletter.com/hundredrabbits' method='post' target='popupwindow' onsubmit='window.open('https://tinyletter.com/hundredrabbits', 'popupwindow', 'scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=600');return true'><input type='email' value='' name='EMAIL' class='email' placeholder='email@address.com' required=''><input type='submit' value='Subscribe' name='subscribe' class='button'></form></footer></body></html>

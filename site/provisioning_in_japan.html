Provisioning is easy, but there are challenges, like the language, the scarcity of bulk foods and the absence of Western brands. We have some experience in Japan. We both lived there for a while in 2012, and have traveled there many times. This guide is for people is for people who travel by boat, we hope it helps.</p><h2 id='vocabulary'>vocabulary</h2><ul class='col2'><li> スーパ(suupa) supermarket</li><li>デパ地下 (depachika) Underground department store</li><li>コンビニ (konbini) convenience store</li><li>クレジットカード (Kurejittokaado) credit card</li><li>お金 (okane) money</li><li>紙袋 (kamibukuro) paper bag</li>配送 (haiso) delivery</li><li>半額 (hangaku) half price</li><li>おつまみ (otsumami) snack</li><li>漬物 (tsukemono) pickles</li><li>ビール (biiru) beer</li><li>野菜 (yasai) vegetables</li><li>果物 (kudamono) fruits</li>ミルク (miruku) milk</li><li>豆乳 (tonyuu) soy milk</li><li>肉 (niku) meat</li>魚 (sakana) fish</li><li>白米 (hakumai) white rice</li><li>コーヒ(coohii) coffee</li><li>食べ物 (tabemono) food</li><li>青果 (seika) vegetables and fruits</li><li>揚げ物 (agemono) fried foods</li>おにぎり (onigiri) rice ball</li><li>弁当 (bentou) lunch box</li><li>ワイン (wain) wine</li><li>ティ(cha) tea</li><li>カレ(karee) Japanese curry</li><li>飲み物 (nomimono) drink</li><li>パン (pan) bread</li>塩 (shio) salt</li><li>小麦粉 (komugiko) flour</li><li>サラダ (sarada) salad</li><li>ビニールぶくろ (biniiru fukuro) plastic bag</li><li>いくら?

In larger cities, they don't provide shopping carts because people buy food for the day and the next. Suupas sell meat, seafood, produce (veggie, fruits, mushrooms), dairy, soybean products (tofu, miso, soy sauce, natto), snacks (sweets, rice crackers), beer, liquor, pre-made deli dishes (salads, deep fried foods, lunch boxes) as well as rice, bread, noodles, cereals, sauces and frozen/canned goods.</p><p>When browsing for goods, you'll notice that the stores include the tax in the labelled price, and that they price fruit and vegetables per item, not per weight. Supermarkets are in the suburbs, town and villages. They're harder to find in big city centers. They open around 9 or 10 h, and close around 21-22 h. </p><h3>Cashier checkout</h3><p>When you walk to a register with your basket, leave the items in it and place it on the checkout counter. The cashier will process your items one-by-one, calling out the price of each item out loud. Then, they'll place the items in another basket (which you will take to a separate packing area). Some checkout counters have two people, one who scans your items and the other who handles the cash</p><p>Common names of supermarkets include <b>Seiyu</b>, <b>SUMMIT</b>, <b>LIFE</b>, <b>Maruetsu</b>, <b>Ito Yokado</b>, <b>Don Quixote</b>, <b>AEON</b>, <b>OK Store</b> etc.</p><h2 id='konbini'>konbini</h2><p>Konbinis, or convenience stores, are open 24 h/day, 6 days/week and 365 days/year. They don't close, even during holidays. They offer many services like WIFI, toilets, ATMs, machines to buy concert/bus tickets, and sometime even tables to eat on-site. They stock prepared foods, beer, liquor, beer snacks (otsumami), heated cans of coffee, cold drinks, soft drinks, milk, desserts and a limited selection of fresh vegetables and fruit. Many konbinis sell basic medicine, toiletries and convenience items like socks, shirts etc.</p><p>Konbini stores include <b>7-Eleven</b>, <b>Family Mart</b>, <b>Lawson</b>, <b>100 Lawson</b> (dollar lawson), <b>Natural Lawson</b> (organic food), <b>Mini Mart</b>, <b>AM PM</b> etc.</p><h2 id='depachika'>depachika</h2><p>Below the surface, in the basements of department stores are food floors known as 'depachika' (デパ地下 literally: department store underground). Depachikas are a great place to pick up bento, snacks, souvenirs, groceries, gifts, souvenirs and desserts.</p><p> Food in depachika is expensive, but their selection is incredible. They carry many high-end products, so it might be worth going if you're looking for a rare item. Japanese people will visit to buy ceremonial and seasonal gift items.</p><h2 id='discounted_items'>discounted items</h2><p>Many supermarkets mark down unsold lunch items around 14 h, and other prepared foods around 19 h. Discounts start off at a 10-20 %, and increase until closing. Supermarkets also discount fruit and veg in this way.</p><h2 id='fruits_and_vegetables'>fruits and vegetables</h2><p>Japanese groceries are well-stocked, but fruit and veg (especially fruit) are pricey. This is because the Ministry of agriculture regulates production, and ensures output of the highest quality. As a result, the Japanese buy select fruit as a special treat, or as a gift.</p><p>The use of seasonal ingredients in food has high value in Japan. Here, we introduce local produce by season:</p><h3>Summer</h3><p>Corn, edamame, goya, okra, eggplant, shiso, tomato, lettuce, bell pepper, summer cabbage, kyuuri (cucumbers), chinese plums, muskmelon, peach, watermelon, yuzu, grape and cherries</p><h3>Fall</h3><p>Sweet potato, matsutake, saitomo, pumpkin, ginkgo nuts, rice (first harvest), shimeji, shiitake, maitake, sudachi, Japanese chestnuts, kaki and Japanese pears</p><h3>Winter</h3><p>Chinese cabbage, daikon, renkon, turnip, cabbage, minkan (mandarine/satsuma oranges), strawberry and apples.</p><h3>Spring</h3><p>Bamboo shoots, udo, shiitake, potatoes, strawberry, citrus and loquat.</p><h2 id='farmer's_market'>farmer's market</h2><p>Many cities in Japan have farmer's markets. In Japanese, they're called 朝市 (asaichi), which means 'morning markets'. They're not easy to find if you don't speak the language, plus their schedules vary month to month per location. To find a market in your area, try to search online for <b>朝市</b> or <b>ファーマーズマーケット</b>, plus your city/area name in Japanese.</p><p>For example, if you live in Mie (三重), you would type <b>朝市 三重</b>. You can also try and search through <a href='http://www.asaichi.ne.jp/'>Asaichi network service</a>, or asking locals by saying:</p><ul class='bullet'><li>朝市は近くにありますか</li><li>asaichi wa chikaku ni arimasu ka?</li></li>Is there a farmer's market nearby?</li></ul></p><h3>Markets</h3><ul class='bullet'><li><a href='http://farmersmarkets.jp/'>Farmer’s Market at UNU</a> (Aoyama, Tokyo) weekends</li><li><a href='http://timealive.jp/marche/'>Market of the sun</a> (Tsukishima, Tokyo) 2nd weekends</li><li>Yurakucho Market (Tokyo) weekends</li><li><a href='http://zanoichi.seesaa.net/'>Koenji Market</a> (Koenji, Tokyo) 3rd saturdays</li><li>Nara Organic Farmers Market (Nara)</li><li>Ashikita Sashiki Farmers Market (Kushimoto)</li><li>Okayama's farmer's market (Okayama)</li><li>Itadaki Ichi (Owase, Mie)</li></ul><h2 id='bread'>bread</h2><p>Bread is available in most markets, but the packages are small and the slices are thick. Don't expect to find any whole wheat loaves. Some supermarkets carry whole wheat, but it's not common. Bread sold in supermarkets and konbinis is often very sweet, light and fluffy. Finding artisan-style bread is not easy, but it is possible. Bigger cities have German or French-style bakeries, which offer a variety of both sweet and savory breads.<h2 id='rice'>rice</h2><p>Rice is a staple crop in Japan, it's a daily source of energy and plays an important part in many aspects of Japanese culture. It's importance cannot be overstated. The rice is planted in the spring, and harvested in early September. There are many kinds of rice grown in Japan, but the most common is the short-grain type. The main types are uruchimai 粳米 (sushi rice) and mochigome 餅米 (for sweets, rice cakes). Below is a list of kanji that you can use when navigating the shelves:</p><ul class='bullet'><li>米 (kome) raw rice</li><li>白米 (hakumai) white rice</li><li>玄米 (genmai) brown rice</li><li>精米 (Seimai) milled rice</li><li>無洗米 (Musenmai) unwashed rice</li><li>特別栽培米 （Tokubetsusaibaimai) specially cultivated rice</li><li>発芽玄米 (hatsuga genmai) germinated brown rice</li><li>米ぬか (komenuka) rice bran</li></ul><p>Most supermarkets in Japan sell ready-polished rice in 10 kg, 5 kg, and smaller bags. Brown rice is sometimes sold in 30 kg bags. Price of rice can vary from 300 – 2,000 JPY per kilo. Price is driven by quality, scarcity, and processing.</p><p> There are many words for 'rice' in Japanese, for instance 米 kome (raw uncooked grain ), ご飯 gohan (cooked rice) and 飯 meshi (also cooked rice) are the same word, but have a different pronunciations.</p><p>As a final note on rice, if you want to make your meals more interesting you can buy ふりかけ (furikake), which is a dry Japanese seasoning meant to be sprinkled on top of cooked rice and other dishes. There are many flavors consisting of a mixture of chopped seaweed, sugar, salt, shiso, vegetables, katsuoboshi, dried fish etc. The product was commercialized in 1948 on the basis that it provided a good source of protein and calcium to Japanese people, it was manufactured to address pervasive malnourishment during World War I.</p><h2 id='saying_no_to_plastic_bags'>Saying no to plastic bags</h2><p>Japan prides itself for the quality of its customer service, they treat clients with the upmost respect by paying attention to details and offering items like plastic bags, forks, spoons, chopsticks etc for your convenience. These items are all included by default, at no extra charge. In today's climate though, we have to strive to be conscientious shoppers and this translates to avoiding non-reusable products. So how do you communicate this in Japanese while being polite?</p><h3>Useful words</h3><ul class='col2'><li>大丈夫 (daijoubou) ok</li><li>おもち (o mochi) to have</li><li>いります (irimasu) Verb, to 'need'</li><li>ください (kudasai) please</li><li>けっこうです (kekkou desu) No thanks.</li><li>その まま で (sono mama de) as is</li><li>ストロー (sutoraa) Straw</li><li>おはし (ohashi) Chopsticks</li><li>スプーン (Supuunu) Spoon</li><li>フォーク (fookuu) Fork</li><li><li>紙袋 (kamibukuro) Paper bag</li><li>袋 (fukuro) bag</li></ul><p>How to decline bags in Japanese.</p><ul class='bullet'><li>袋、けっこうです (bukuro kekkou desu) No shopping bag, thank you.</li><li>袋 は いりません (fukuro wa irimassen) I don't need a bag</li><li>その まま で ください (sono mama de kudasai) I'll take it as is.</li><li>袋 は 大丈夫 です (fukuro wa daijoubou desu) I'm okay for a bag.</li></ul><p>The cashier will respond with kashikomarimashita かしこまりました which is a polite expression meaning 'understood'. Sometimes, the cashier will ask if you want a bag by saying:</p><ul class='bullet'><li>袋を おもちですか？ (furuko o mochi desu ka?) Do you have a bag?</li></ul><p>Your answer:</p><ul class='bullet'><li>はい、大丈夫 です (hai, daijoubou desu) Yes, it's okay. I don't need a bag.</li><li>Literally: Yes, it's okay.</li></ul><p>In other cases, the cashier might ask...</p><ul class='bullet'><li><袋 お いりますか？ (fukuro o irimasu ka?) Do you need a bag?</li></ul><p>Your answer:</p><ul class='bullet'><li>いいえ 、大丈夫 です (iie, daijoubou desu) No I'm ok without a bag.</li></ul><p>If you buy a prepared dish, they will ask you if you want chopsticks, and you can decline using the examples above by replace 'fukuro' with 'o hashi' (お はし).</p><h2 id='condiments'>condiments</h2><p>Japan has many condiments, I'll go through the most popular ones, listing their properties and uses.</p><h3>Mirin</h3><p>Mirin, or 味醂 or みりん, is a condiment in Japanese cuisine. It's a type of rice wine but with a lower alcohol and higher sugar content than sake. The sugars form naturally during the fermentation process, and are not added.</p><p>There are 3 types: Hon mirin (true mirin), which contains about 14% alcohol, second is Shio mirin which has less alcohol (lower than 1.5%) and third is Shin mirin, which has less than 1% alcohol while retaining the same flavor.</p><p>Mirin adds sweetness to dishes, it helps tenderize foods while masking unwanted flavors and adds luster to dishes.</p><h3>Soy sauce</h3><p>Soy sauce, called Shoyu in Japanese (醤油), is a staple of Japanese cuisine and is as ubiquitous as salt. The Japanese use is to flavor and enhance dishes, to season ingredients, to enhance the color of dishes and to make sauces and dressings.</p><p>Japanese soy sauce is more delicate than Chinese, Korean or Thai soy sauce. It has a complex umami flavor. There are two types:</p><ul class='bullet'><li>Koikuchi shoyu (濃口醤油, dark-colored soy sauce)</li><li>Usukuchi shoyu (薄口醤油, light-colored soy sauce)</li><li>Amakuchi shoyu (甘口, sweet soy sauce)</li></ul><p>Koikuchi is available in Eastern Japan, it is dark-colored with a slight fruity flavor. It's made with a higher ratio of soybeans, and is sometimes produced without wheat. Usukuchi is light, and has a saltier taste, it is preferred in the West of Japan. Light soy sauce is ideal to make noodle soup or simmered dishes. Amakuchi soy sauce is sweet and common in Southern Japan.</p><h3>Miso</h3><p>Miso, or みそ, is a traditional Japanese seasoning produced by fermenting soybeans with both salt and koji (fungus Aspergillus oryzae) and sometimes with rice, barley and seaweed. Miso is salty, but it's flavor and aroma depends on the ingredients used or the fermentation process. There is a wide variety of Japanese miso, it is typically classified by grain type (barley, buckwheat, rice etc), color (white, brown, black & red), taste (sweet 甘味噌, mild 甘口味噌, salty 辛口味噌, earthy, fruity etc) and background (where it's from). The most common miso flavor categories are:</p><ul class='bullet'><li>Shiromiso 白味噌 (white)</li><li>Akamiso 赤味噌 (red)</li><li>Awasemiso 合わせ味噌 (mixed)</li></ul><p>Miso is delicious when used in soup, as a dressing for salad, in ramen, as a flavouring for tofu etc</p><h3>Rice vinegar</h3><p>Japanese Rice vinegar 米酢 'komezu' or simply 'su' has a very mild taste, and is either colorless or yellow. Japanese rice vinegar is made from rice. This type of vinegar is less acidic than Chinese varieties, and are used to season rice, and for making 'sunomono' (vinegar dishes) and 'tsukemono' (pickles). There are some kinds of Japanese rice vinegars that are 'seasoned', meaning that they have additives like sake, salt and sugar, for added flavor. Seasoned varieties include 'sushizu'.</p><p>Rice vinegar is known for its anti-bacterial properties.</p><h3>Dashi</h3><p>Dashi is a soup stock and essential condiment in Japanese cuisine. Dashi contains one or two ingredients, and is often made from konbu 昆布だし (dried kelp), katsuoboshi (dried bonito flakes), shiitake (mushrooms), iriko/niboshi (dried anchovies/sardines) or a combination of these. Dashi creates a sweet, savoury umami flavor.</p><p>Dashi is used as a broth base for Japanese hot pot dishes, simmered dishes, noodle soups, it's also used as a seasoning liquid (for rice). Konbu dashi is the easiest stock to make, it has a subtle taste and is often mixed with shiitake dashi. The mushrooms used to make shiitake dashi are used for cooking.<p><h2 id='cans'>Cans</h2><p>Japan produces many canned products, a lot of flavored fish and meats, but since we don't eat those on our boat I've no experience with them. Grocery stores stock vegetables and beans in cans, but the cans are small and expensive. Although they have great options, like chickpeas mixed with seaweed and root vegetables and flavored pickles (Takuan no Kanzume).<h2 id='provisioning_online'>Provisioning online</h2><p>It is possible to order some goods online. If at a marina for a while, this method of provisioning should be considered. Amazon Japan is amazing, and the shipping is very fast and cheap. It's possible to order Costco food through <a href='www.fbcusa.com'>Foreign's Buyer's club</a>, but it's very pricy and takes a while to ship.</p><p>Here is a list of websites and stores where you can buy difficult-to-find items:</p><ul class='bullet'><li><a href='https://www.cuoca.com'Cuoca</a></li><li><a href='www.fbcusa.com'Foreign buyer's club</a></li><li><a href='www.iherb.com.html' target='_self' class='local'>iherb</a>(online)</li><li><a href='https://www.amazon.co.jp/アリサン有限会社-オートミール-1kg/dp/B007OPEI3E/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?s=food-beverage&ie=UTF8&qid=1551056959&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=オートミール&psc=1&smid=A2YIIVSNGIUGVA' target='_blank' class='external'>Alishan</a> (online)</li><li><a href='https://www.kaldi.co.jp/English/friends.php' target='_blank' class='external'>Kaldi</a> (online, there's also a store)</li></ul></p><h2 id='peanut_butter'>Peanut butter</h2><p>Peanut butter is sometimes available, but is more common in big cities like Tokyo. There are 3 main varieties: <ul class='bullet'><li>ピーナッツペースト, peanut butter pesto</li><li>ピーナッツバタークリーム (or クリーミー) peanut butter cream</li><li>ピーナッツバターpeanut butter</li></ul><p>Peanut butter 'pesto' is 100% ground peanuts without additives, peanut butter cream is very very sweet (tastes more like caramel) and peanut butter can be both 100% peanuts and one with additives such as salt, sugar and oil.</p><p>Common brands include: Saniku Foods Peanut Butter, Youki foods, Skippy and Alishan Organic Peanut butter.</p><p>Sweetened varieties of peanut butter, like Skippy, are almost always available at large supermarkets that deal with imported goods, such as <b><a href='http://www.seijoishii.co.jp/stor_index.html'>Seijo Ishii</a></b>, <b><a href='https://www.yamaya.jp/'>Yamaya</a></b>, <b><a href='http://www.reimei.info/'>Reimei</a></b> or <b><a href='http://meidi-ya-store.com/store_guide/index.html'>Meiji-ya</a></b>. Pesto peanut butter is harder to find in store, but it is available. Brands like Saniku foods are sometimes sold in regular grocery stores, <a href='https://www.picspeanutbutter.com/buy/buy-in-store/japan/'>Pic's</a> is reserved for special stores, while <a href='https://www.cuoca.com/fs/cuoca/01788900'>Alishan products</a> are sold online. I'd avoid peanut butter cream, as much as possible.</p><h2 id='oats'>Oats</h2><p>Oats is called 麦 (mugi) in Japanese, although this word is also used for barley and wheat. Some groceries carry indivually-wrapped packets of Quaker Oats, others sell 300 g bags, but more often oats are sold as part of granola. It's more cost-effective to buy oats online on Amazon or Cuoca, otherwise at a Costco. Common brands of oats include Tomiz, Alishan and Misshoku's.</p><h2 id='baking_goods'>Baking goods</h2><p>Japanese grocery stores always carry white flour, but whole grain flours is a rarity. Here are the main varieties: <ul class='bullet'><li>Hakurikiko (薄力粉）Weak flour/Soft Flour (baking and for general use)</li><li>Kyoryokuko (強力粉）Strong Flour (bread making)</li>ZenryuFun (全粒粉) (whole wheat flour)</li><li>Superuto komugiko (スペルト小麦粉) (spelt flour)</li><li>Raimugi-ko (ライ麦粉) (rye flour)</li></ul><p>White flour is easy to find in most grocery stores, but whole grain varieties are more rare (they can be purchased online in bulk through Cuoca or Amazon). Self-raising flours are not sold in Japan, but you can make them with Hakurikiko and baking powder ベーキングパウダ(beikingu paudaa).</p><p>Common brands of whole grain flours include Pioneer (2 kg), Nisshin (1 kg), Tomiz (1 kg) and Ebetsu (5 kg).</p><p>In Japanese, yeast is called ドライイースト for dry yeast and 予備発酵不要 (yobi hakkou fuyou) for quick yeast. It's possible to find larger bags of yeast at both Sato Shokai or Amika.</p><h2 id='beans_and_legumes'>Beans and legumes</h2><p>Finding certain varieties of beans or legumes (chickpeas, kidney beans, lentils) is hard in grocery stores. Beans are often sold in small plastic packets (1 portion), or in tiny cans (also 1 portion). Chickpeas are available in larger cans at stores like Kaldi.</p><p>Dried chickpeas are even rarer birds, I'd suggest making the switch to local products like <a href='https://www.justonecookbook.com/azuki-beans/'>Azuki (小豆)</a>, <a href='https://www.justonecookbook.com/kuromame-sweet-black-soybeans/'>Kuromame (黒豆)</a> and Soybeans (daizu 大豆). Soybeans are a very good alternative to chickpeas in hummus, and it's possible to buy large quantities of cans (24 pack) on Amazon.</p><h2 id='allergies'>allergies</h2><p>The word for allergy is アレルギー or 'arerugii'. The Japanese Agricultural Standards (JAS) Law stipulates 27 types of allergens that must be labeled on processed foods. These include milk (乳), eggs (卵), flour (小麦), buckwheat (そば), peanuts (落花生), shrimp (えび), crab (かに), abalone (あわび), squid (いか), salmon eggs (いくら), orange (オレンジ), kiwi (キウイフルーツ), beef (牛肉), walnut (くるみ), alcohol (酒), mackerel (さば), soy (大豆), chicken (鶏肉), pork (豚肉), matsutake mushroom (まつたけ), peach (もも), yam (やまいも), apple (りんご), gelatin (ゼラチン), banana (バナナ), flax/sesame (ごま), cashew (カシューナッツ).</p><p>It should be noted that these 20 allergens are recommended for labeling, not mandatory, so products containing these allergens may not be overtly labeled.</p><p>If you like our content, consider supporting us.</p><a class='patreon button' href='https://patreon.com/100'>PATREON</a><hr/></main><footer><p>Never miss an update</p><form action='https://tinyletter.com/hundredrabbits' method='post' target='popupwindow' onsubmit='window.open('https://tinyletter.com/hundredrabbits', 'popupwindow', 'scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=600');return true'><input type='email' value='' name='EMAIL' class='email' placeholder='email@address.com' required=''><input type='submit' value='Subscribe' name='subscribe' class='button'></form></footer></body></html>

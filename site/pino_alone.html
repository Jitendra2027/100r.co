For us, this happened this year in Japan. We'd never left our Yammy alone before, never for more than a week. We were apprehensive at first, but decided it would be a good learning experience, for us and our beloved.</p><p>Whenever we mentioned leaving our boat in Japan, people would say 'aren't you afraid of typhoons?' Our 6 month leave coincided with the time of year typhoons swing northward, affecting Japan, with August to October being the worse months. Yes, we were worried, but knew that the only way to ensure Pino's safety, was to prepare well. We spent weeks planning for our departure, doing research on how to keep a boat safe in a storm, but also, how to keep mold and insects at bay in our absence.</p><p>While away in Canada, I had night anxiety, stress dreams about what was happening to Pino. These dreams involved us returning to the boat, only to find it turned into a moldy, water-logged cockroach motel. These visions appeared at night, when I had too much time to think. Having no experience leaving the boat behind, I had no guarantee that we'd done enough.</p><p>When we returned 6 months later, we found no mold, no bugs and no damage, in fact, we slept in that same night. Pino endured weeks of hot Japanese summers, tropical rain and winter winds. We're happy to say that our preparations WERE enough.</p><p>Here are some basic rules we followed:</p><ul class='bullet'><li>Ventilation is key.</li><li>Free the decks.</li><li>Don't keep food.</li><li>Clean everything.</li><li>Store away everything.</li><li>Don't leave openings.</li><li>Tie things down.</li></ul><h2 id='ventilation_is_key'>Ventilation is key</h2><p>Summers in Japan are very hot and humid, with temperature reaching as high as 36 °C. In early summer, we left Pino to visit some friends in Tokyo for 1 week. On our return, we found mold on the walls and on some clothes we'd left outside our plastic bins. This happened because our boat was closed up too tight, there was no airflow. We have four dorads, but for a boat sitting unattended, dorade boxes do not result in enough air exchange by themselves to prevent moisture buildup. To remedy this, we installed two fans, one at the bow and one at the stern.</p><p>We considered getting fans from a marine store, but their price deterred us. They're expensive in Canada, but evne more so in Japan. The price of marine-grade items are triple the cost. For example, I saw a Mustang PFD for 980Y. We instead went the cheaper route, and purchased two Panasonic exhaust pipe fans from a local hardware store. Being in a marina, we had the luxury of being connected to shore power, which meant we could have powered fans.</p><p>For the summer, we made a custom screen door for the companionway, and installed the first fan in it. It allowed air to flow in and out through the screen, and the fan would help it along.</p><p>I know what you're thinking — you left your boat unattended with a screen door? Aren't you worried about theft? No. In Japan, theft is rare. Also, our marina is a 30 minute walk to the nearest town, which has a small population consisting mainly of eldery people. In hindsight, we were right not to worry. The marina has staff onsite most days, and at night, the paths are guarded by the resident deer and wild boars. That last part is true. Walking outside at night is discouraged in this area, because accidents with animals have happened.</p><p>To ensure water wouldn't come in through the screen door, we attached a piece of canvas from the top of the sliding hatch door, held at an angle (so it wouldn't touch the screen), with its 2 bottom corners attached to points on either side. We stitched a pocket at the bottom of the piece of canvas, and slid an old mainsail batten in it. Keeping the canvas at an angle kept the rain off, while allowing air to flow. The canvas stayed put, even after the passage of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Faxai_(2019)'>typhoon Faxai</a> (cat 4) and super <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Hagibis_(2019)'>typhoon Hagibis</a> (cat 5).</p><p>We installed a second fan in the head, near the bow. This fan would suck the air out. With two fans installed, the air would enter from one end and exit from the other.</p><p>Our head was previously equipped with a solar fan, an accessory not suited to offshore waters. It came with the boat. With this fan, waves that washed over the deck would sometimes come spilling inside — not ideal. When in the head, in your private time, the last thing you want is to have a salt water shower. After an an especially boisterous sail, we discovered the fan motor had corroded, and so we removed it. We hought of replacing it with another solar fan, one with an option to shut it from inside, but the models available in Japan were above our price range. And so, we opted to fill the gap in the ceiling with a deckplate. Our idea was to install a temporary fan, with pieces sourced, again, from the local hardware store.</p><p>Evidently, the store supplies parts for houses, nothing made specific for yachts. We bought an outer vent — with a dorad-like shape — which fit our deckplate hole, as well as a corner pipe with connected to it from inside. The fan fit into the end of the inside pipe perfectly. This setup, while clunky-looking, worked well for us. We added foam around the pipe to make sure it wouldn't move, or allow water to slip inside, and taped around the outside piece. When we left, we opened the head door and attached a bungee cord to the handle, keeping it propped open to allow air to pass. Of course, this pipe set up isn't meant for offshore sailing. On passages, we plan to remove the fan and close up the deckplate.</p><h2 id='don't_keep_food'>Don't keep food</h2><p>Food in a boat is a buffet for insects. They will more than happy to feast on whatever you leave behind. In warm climates, weevils spawn from — and feed on — grains, beans and seeds. Infestation-prone products include wheat, corn, macaroni, oats, barley, sorghum, kaffir seed, and buckwheat. To prevent unwanted lodgers, we ate up most of our grains, beans and seeds and dumped the rest. We stored the less-problematic items — like gluten flour and nutritional yeast — in glass or sealed containers. Adding oxygen absorbers (powdered iron oxide packets) to the jars is a good way to keep products free of moisture, we didn't do this, but will next time.</p><p>On a boat, canned products are common. We had cans left over from our time in New Zealand and Fiji. We inspected the cans, and discarded the ones with too much rust. The rest, we stored in a sealed plastic bin. We had previously removed the tags from cans, marking the contents of the can in permanent marker. Despite all our preparations, mistakes happen. I opened several cans labelled as 'beans' which turned out to be 'mushrooms'. Woops. Mindfulness is key when labelling cans. We had to rethink our meal — not a big deal. The incident made us laugh, it left us wondering what else was falsely labelled as mushrooms.</p><h2 id='free_the_decks'>Free the decks</h2><p>We hosed down our headsail and mainsail, left them to dry, folded them up and stored them in the v-berth. We washed all of our lines, soaking them in water and rinsing them out afterward. They stayed outside to dry, hanging from the lifelines. Once dry, we found a spot for them in our cockpit locker to keep them out of the sun. We removed as much of our running rigging as we could, but lacking time we had to leave some of the halyards in. In an ideal world, all of them should have been removed, and replaced with sacrificial lines. We secured the jib halyard downward with its own line, tying it to a cleat at the bow.</p><p>We removed the boom halyard, and replaced it with a sacrificial line. We also tied the boom down, with a rope from the boom end, connecting to two opposing cleats. With the lines on, it couldn't move.</p><p>Our boat lacks a bimini, so we had no issues there, but we kept the dodger on. Our dodger is very old, so we didn't put it down in fear that it would not sit back up right again — yep, our canvasing is that old! What we did do was to open the front. The front of the dodger has a zippered flap, in the summer when it's hot, it can be folded up to allow air to pass. When Typhoon Krosa brushed by Shikoku, its effects reached north as far as Mie. The day before the storm, we saw other yachties preparing their boats. Many of the boats in the marina were racing yachts and had no dodgers, but the ones that had them kept them up, and opened the front. We mirrored their preparations. When in doubt, do like the locals. Our dodger suffered no damage. We put extra lines on it to as a precaution. We removed both of our lee clothes, washing them before rolling them up and storing them.</p><p>All diesel and gas bins were stashed away inside the aft locker, with the empty ones going on the starboard locker, along with all our buckets and loose items.</p><h2 id='clean_everything'>Clean everything</h2><p>Residual salt and dirt, in a hot and humid setting, can accelerate the formation of mold and mildew. To prevent this, we cleaned everything. And I do mean EVERYTHING. We washed our clothes, settee cushions, foul-weather gear, glass jars, the inside of lockers, the walls, floors — everything.</p><p>A day before we left, we wiped down all surfaces with white vinegar using a cloth and spray bottle. For better results, heat the vinegar prior to use. If heating the vinegar isn't an option, let it sit on the surface for 10 minutes before wiping it off.</p><p>Washing the cushions was a hell of an ordeal. The settee cushions have covers with zippers, but are held down by two buttons. These buttons give the top of the cushions a better shape, but given the fact they'd begun to rust, we cut them off and threw them away. We removed all the covers and handwashed them in warm soapy water. We washed them by hand because we feared that they would shrink. All the covers were sun-dried. The back cushions of our settees were tricky to remove. They double as doors to lockers, and to remove the cover to clean them, we had to unscrew and remove all 6 doors. It had to be done. It gave us the opportunity to inspect the hinges and ball catches. We cleaned and oiled them.</p><p>Winters in Mie aren't too cold. The temperature never reaches freezing point, and so we didn't think it necessary to winterize our outboard engine. Before we left, we filled the tank and added stabilizer — something we do on every fill up. Stabilizer displaces water, should there be moisture in the piping or elsewhere. We closed the water intake valve, and that was it. For our outboard engine, we removed the gas left in it, then added a new batch along with some stabilizer. Adding STA-BIL is supposed to keep the gas fresh for up 12 months. Another step, was to change the oil and to fill it up again. As for our generator, like the outboard, we changed the gas and oil and added stabilizer.</p><h2 id='store_everything_away'>Store everything away</h2><p>Before putting everything away, it's important to make sure that all items are dry. Wetness accelerates rot. We put every loose item away, this includes paper, shoes, clothes, blankets, tools, books and small electronics.</p><p>We kept our larger tools in a large airtight pelican case, with the rest sitting in an old canvas bag. On our return, we found some of the tools in the canvas bag had rust. I soaked the affected tools in a tub of white vinegar for a few hours. The acetic acid in vinegar reacts to the rust, forming a layer overtop of the metal. After soaking, I wiped the rust away and let it dry completely. Once dry, I added a light coating of WD-40, and stored ALL tools away in the pelican case. If we leave the boat again, we plan to include moisture absorbers like <b>silica gel</b> or <b>camphor tablets</b>. Many products ship with silica gel packets, it's easy to accumulate and re-use them. They do lose absorbency over time, but it's possible to recharge them by heating the silica in the oven. Camphor tablets are excellent at absorbing moisture, and double as a means of keeping both rust and insects at bay. Camphor tablets 'melt' over time, creating no mess because it undergoes a process known as sublimation, starting from a solid state to a gaseous state without an intervening liquid state. If using camphor tablet, don't unwrap them, leave them wrapped in the cellophane and with a pocket knife or a screwdriver, just pierce the wrapper. They will last longer this way.</p><p>After washing and drying our clothes, sheets and blankets, we put them away in plastic bags. We removed as much air as we could, and stacked them all in the quarter berth. Adding dryer sheets, or cedar balls to the bags helps to absorb lingering moisture. Our books, as well as any paper product, had a similar treatment. We bought sturdy plastic bags and packed the larger books individually, and the thinner ones in groups. We plan to keep the books in the bags, and take them out as we want to read them.</p><p>Electronics are also prone to rust. We left with two laptops, but the raspberry pis, ipad, music instruments remained onboard, stored away in plastic bins. We'd kept many moisture absorbers from shipped packages, and added one to every storage box.</p><h2 id='reducing_ambient_moisture'>Reducing ambient moisture</h2><p>In old style Japanese houses, it's common to put big bags of crushed bamboo charcoal under the floor boards. Bamboo charcoal is hygroscopic, taking in 3-5X more water than regular charcoal. We purchased 5 bags through a supplier in Japan and placed these at various key points in the boat, one with the sails in the v-berth, one aft, one in the head and the other two on lockers in the saloon. These bags last a long time, but we'd read that to increase absorption, it's necessary to air them out. On our return, we laid the bags out on deck for a few hours.</p><p>To further decrease moisture levels in the boat, we bought a large 10 kg bag of calcium chloride. Like bamboo charcoal, CH is a dessicant, and does a good job of drawing in water from the air. We bought some stockings at the convenience store, 3 in all, filled them with calcium chloride and went to hang them around the boat with 3 buckets sitting underneath them. We put one in the head, another at the foot of the mast and another near the engine room. We secured the buckets, to make sure they wouldn't tip over and spill their contents.</p><h2 id='tie_things_down'>Tie things down</h2><p>To protect the forward hatch from the sun, we fitted a piece of canvas to it. The piece of canvas covered the hatch, with the four corners attached to long webbing, leading to separate points on the toerail. The ends of the webbing was stitched to the toerails rather than tied, for added strength. For the hatch behind the mast, we used an old piece of foam-backed aluminium, and taped it up with the reflective side facing up. This would keep the sun out, and protect it from debris.</p><p>Our dodger is very old, so we didn't put it down in fear that it would not sit back up right again — yep, our canvasing is that old! What we did do was to open the front. The front of the dodger has a zippered flap, in the summer when it's hot, it can be folded up to allow air to pass. When Typhoon Krosa brushed by Shikoku, its effects reached north as far as Mie. The day before the storm, we saw other yachties preparing their boats. Many of the boats in the marina were racing yachts and had no sprayhoods, but the ones that had them kept them up, and opened the front. We mirrored their preparations. When in doubt, do like the locals. Our dodger suffered no damage. We put extra lines on it to as a precaution.</p><p>After changing the gas, oil and adding sta-bil, our outboard returned to its perch on our aft rail. To protect it from the sun, we purchased a bike basket cover, a product sold in hardware stores in the bicycle accessories section. The shape fit the head of our outboard well enough. We tied ropes around the head to make sure the wind wouldn't take it, as it wasn't THAT well adjusted.</p><p>After everything on deck is secured, comes time to think about keeping the boat tethered to the dock. Our marina was well protected, but was opened from the West. A passing typhoon, we knew, could definitely generate big waves into the marina. To prevent damage to the boat, we purchased two Unimer wraparound snubbers for our prespliced double-braided dock lines. The rubber snubbers serve to absorb combinations of tensile, compressive and shear loads. We ran a long nylon 3-strand line on the deck to use as a spring line, with the workings ends running through chocks on the bow and stern, and tied with a bowline to a dock cleat. The nylon lines, like snubbers, stretch and absorb shock in the event that waves did come into the marina.</p><p>We fitted our bowline loops with plastic tubing, to protect them against chafe, and did the same for all ropes that pass through chocks. As always, we used ample fenders, with 4 on the dock side and 2 on the other, in case the boat next to us broke free.</p><h2 id='leave_no_openings'>Leave no openings</h2><p>The best way to ensure that insects won't find their way into a boat, is to give them no openings. We added screens to the two dorads inside. The aft dorads are harder to add a screen too, in fact, the starboard-side dorad opens directly into the boat... without any piping. We bought some stockings and covered the heads of the dorads with them. This does reduce airflow, a bit, but it's better than leaving them open.</p><p>Our companionway door isn't insect proof. The sliding hatch comes to rest forward of the doors, but there is a gap on the sides. To make sure no insects would try and crawl in through, we stuffed some bits of foam into the cracks. Because the boat was in the water, we didn't bother plugging up the exhaust, or any other water outlets (we've got a exit for our espar heater, as well as for our two manual bilge pumps. The bilge pump seals don't allow critters to crawl through, so we thought it safe.</p><h2 id='bugs'>Bugs</h2><p>When staying in Japan, come July, we noticed some intruders aboard Pino... gokiburi (cockroaches). We were used to keeping the doors open on warm summer nights, but this is something we discovered we could not do here. Cockroaches are everywhere in Japan, the climate here is ideal for them. To make matters worse, our boat was docked near the main ramp, and so we think that this probably made it easier for them to make their way over from land. We chose this spot because it provided the best protection, while it is ideal in the event of a typhoon, it is less than ideal for insects. We battled the gokis for months, and discovered the best thing to do, as the previous section suggested, was to leave no openings. We bought capsules with boric acid, to try and lure out the ones camping aboard, but this proved ineffective. What did work, was putting up little roach motels. I wrote about these motels in another post, if interested, read about it <a href='a_home_for_pino.html#gokiburi_hoi_hoi'>here</a>.</p><p>When we left, we bought some extra motels of doom, and scattered them at key points around the boat. Behind the oven, under the floors, in cupboard corners etc. When we returned aboard 6 months later, all traps came up empty? No lodgers. We think this is because there was none aboard at the time we'd left, and that they weren't able to sneak inside. We used no sprays, but did buy cedar balls and scattered those in all cupboards. If we were to do this again, we'd replace cedar balls with camphor tablets, as they're better at repelling critters.</p><h2 id='our_mistakes'>Our mistakes</h2><p>In the beggining of this post, I mentioned that this was our first time leaving the boat alone, and that we'd done a lot of research prior to starting our preparations. Despite this, we made some mistakes. A big mistake, was not asking anyone to water our batteries. Yes, we have a poor track record when it comes to taking care of our wet batteries. This essential task escaped our minds. It shouldn't have, but it did. We returned to Pino 6 months later to find the house batteries were near dry. This is dangerous, we know. The plates were exposed. We watered them on arrival, and did not see any build up on the plates, but we have to assume that there was some damage.</p><p>On the eve of our departure, we checked the automatic bilge pump and discovered it wasn't working. Upon close inspection, we saw that the fuse had blown, and noticed some corrosion around the casing. We realized that the fuse wasn't the right voltage. We replaced some of the wiring, as well as the casing, and added the correct fuse. If we hadn't realized it wasn't functional, this could have been disastrous for Pino. We could have returned to a flooded boat. Always, always check your bilge pumps are working.<p><p>We bought two Unimer wraparound snubbers for our lines, but failed to see how difficult they'd be to remove. Removing lines from these snubbers is very, very HARD. I had to do it to re-adjust their position on the line, and it took forever. Purchasing Unimer U-cleat, while more expensive, would have been a better choice, as it's likely we'll be taking the snubbers on and off a lot.</p><p>Emptying and cleaning the water tank is necessary. We emptied it, and were supposed to clean it up but we ran out of time. This was a task reserved for the last day, but we ended up having to deal with a problem with our automatic bilge pump instead. So, we left this task unfinished, and left feeling rather guilty, knowing that it might cause problems on our return. When we got back, we opened the tank and saw no growth, this may have been because we routinely treat the water with bleach, although I'm not certain that this was what prevented it. I flushed out the tank anyway, adding more bleach, giving it a good clean before re-filling it again.</p><p>When we left Pino, in a time when we were rushing to get things done, we forgot vacuum-sealed bags of cornmeal and buckwheat in a locker. Neither bags spawned weevils. We were lucky.</p></p><p>Storing a boat in a foreign country requires a lot of planning, work and a bit of ingenuity. All in all, Japan is a good place to leave a boat, but finding a spot on the hard is difficult, and expensive, this is why our boat was left in the water. While in the marina, the harbourmaster and yard workers kept their eyes on Pino. We k The reason we left Pino, was because we wanted to spend another season in the country. Now, we can say that it was worth it, it's an amazing place to return to after months of absence. It was worth the trouble. Would we do it again? If we have to, yes, and this time, we'll take better care of our batteries.</p><h2 id='references'>References</h2><ul><li><a href='https://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/weevils-on-stored-grain' target='blank'>Weevils on stored grains</a>, Department of Entomology (Penn State University).</li><li><a href='https://www.cruisingworld.com/tropical-boat-storage/ target='_blank'>Tropical boat storage</a>, Cruising world.</li><li><a href='https://global.rakuten.com/en/store/taketora/item/su00237/' target='_blank'>Bamboo charcoal bags</a>, Taketora.</li><li><a href='https://www.liveabout.com/keep-your-boat-dry-and-prevent-mildew-2915362' target='_blank'>How to keep your boat dry and prevent mildew</a>, Liveaboutdotcom.</li><li><a href='https://extension.colostate.edu/docs/pubs/foodnut/kitchen-sanitize.pdf' target='_blank'>Cleaning and sanitizing the kitchen</a>, Ohio state university.</li><li><a href='https://www.pbo.co.uk/gear/pbo-tested-12-mooring-snubbers-45131' target='_blank'>Testing 12 mooring snubbers</a>, Practical Boat Owner.</li></ul><hr/></main><footer><p>Never miss an update</p><form action='https://tinyletter.com/hundredrabbits' method='post' target='popupwindow' onsubmit='window.open('https://tinyletter.com/hundredrabbits', 'popupwindow', 'scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=600');return true'><input type='email' value='' name='EMAIL' class='email' placeholder='email@address.com' required=''><input type='submit' value='Subscribe' name='subscribe' class='button'></form></footer></body></html>
